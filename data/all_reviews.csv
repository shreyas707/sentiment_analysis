5,I simply put my AT&amp;T; SIM card from other phone and it works just fine It is Dual SIM slot so you can play ...,"September 29, 2017",1,"I believe this model is for Europe so it comes with 220 voltage cable charger. At least mine did..Therefore, you need 110v charging cable or wireless charger if you are considering this in US..But given this age, I'm sure people have lots of 110v chargers lying around...I simply put my AT&amp;T; SIM card from other phone and it works just fine.It is Dual SIM slot so you can play it with either two SIM cards or one SIM and a SD card...Battery life is decent. I talk to other people quite a bit, occasional youtube and surfing internet on daily basis and battery lasts good for me..I had S7 edge with 3,600 mAh before and surprisingly, I feel both have similar battery life, so no complaining for me..I assume that software optimization works well as Samsung presents..But if battery life is still your main concern, then simply put battery saving mode, and you will be fine since there isn't much of performance loss from it...S pen is certainly a nice thing to play with. I can draw, write things on the phone. Personally, it helps me a lot for my new work environment...I don't use Bixby much but voice commands seem to work accurately..I don't have a big hand, but location of its button doesn't bother me that much...I don't use finger print unlock thingy at all so no comments on that..Iris scan feature works well too, if you are interested. But I use pattern unlock most of time...This supposedly great dual camera works fine. Quality of pictures are certainly nice and sharp. But because photography is my acutal/serious hobby, I use DSLR a lot. So this dual camera isn't that attractive to me. Don't get me wrong though, it will serve you great for sure. I bought this phone for S pen, not camera...As many of you know it by now, screen display of this phone is phenomenal. It's beautiful and sucks you right in...I don't know much about sound quality because I use bluetooth earbuds and android auto most of the time. Speaker of the phone itself sounds decent enough but for sure there are better phones for this matter..But it's not game changer for me...I can't compare its overall with equivalent products from Apple or any other brand for that matter, because I've used Samsung phones only since beginning of the time. (being Korean does that easily for you)..To sum up, for people with experiences of Samsung products,.If you want the cool, latest, flagship phone of the time even if S pen is for decoration only and wallet is thick enough, then it's for you..If you want cool, latest, flagship of the time and okay with spending quite sum but not this much and S pen isn't interesting, then S8/S8+ is for you..If you use/will use S pen extensively, and/or seeking upgrade from Note 4, 5 and 7(FE), then it's for you. (Don't forget trade-in deals).If you know that you want this specific phone for sure but don't want pay this much whatsoever and have a patience, then wait til next spring/summer when S9 comes out. (Not an official, but for sure there will be one).If you are okay with wife yelling at you for paying this much on a single phone, then it's for you (totally not personal experience, just saying)..These are my personal opinion, yours will be vary.",59
5,Fantastic device,"January 26, 2018",1,"I had the Note 3 for exactly 4 years. I also bought but never much used the Nokia Lumia 1020 (better camera but lousy OS)...I loved my Note 3 and used it all the time for camera, web searches, MANY audio books, some note-taking and so on. Even used it for a phone!..Now that I have the Note 8, the old Note 3 seems suddenly so old and slow and clunky...I studied reviews of ALL the ""flagship"" phones including the iPhone X (overpriced). I kept thinking I PROBABLY really wanted the S-pen (MUCH improved since Note 3) but still spent many, many hours looking at other options...Finally I decided I did want the pen feature and so Samsung's monopoly won the day...Nothing about the 8 disappoints. It is a fantastic phone and super smooth and fast and elegant and excellent, comparable to or surpassing similarly priced phones, in almost every way...The ONLY problem I have is the sealed in, non-removable battery. But nobody sells a removable battery anymore. Sigh...By the way I use the S-pen (like right now) all the time. It's uses and functionlity are awesome...All-in-all, Samsung has gotten pretty much everything right, I'd say. The amount of design and tech in this thing is utterly awesome. No bloat, smooth ease of use, power!..I guess I love this thing..",5
5,Great phone! Got it from Wireless Place and phone ...,"October 12, 2017",1,"Great phone! Got it from Wireless Place and phone came brand new and factory sealed. Model number is SM-N950F/DS. No ""Samsung Note8"" logo or ""DUOS"" logo on the rear, just a clean and solid ""SAMSUNG"" logo. I am pleased with the seller and so far so good with the phone.",11
4,Great phone and seller(NGP STORE USA),"December 16, 2017",1,Great phone and seller(NGP STORE USA). This order arrived one business day early but then I am just down the coast. Everything was factory sealed and brand new. This Note8 runs 4G like the one I got from T-mobile. No complaints...P.S. The phone came with a clear case in the box for free! I thought it was just a tray to hold the papers. American version of the phone didn't come with a case clear or otherwise.....Will do business with NGP STORE USA again. Highly recommended..,7
5,The best note,"October 5, 2017",1,I must say that I have been a user of the range note from the number 1 I have had all including the 7 the phone is absolutely spectacular order it in blackI have no complaints I did a market study since all my life I have used cell phones of 1 single sim and the one they were offering is double sim it's exactly the same the same features the model is 950F / DS I only use one sim buy a micro sd of 128 gigs and perfect..I bought it to the store that is called wireless place the shipment was super fast I arrived in a day everything sealed definitively if I had to buy another I would do with them.,33
3,SM-N950F + ATT (US) = Not Happy... LTE Speed = Lacking... Wifi Calling = Not Happening... Advanced Messaging = Think Again...,"January 6, 2018",1,"Just got this phone today SM-N950F and can say without a doubt that I am returning it. I have AT&amp;T; in the US and am switching from an Galaxy S8+ to this Note 8. Here are the problems I am having: 1) will not do carrier aggregation therefore maximum download is around 17mbps and upload is around 6mbps while in the exact same location my Galaxy S8+ download is 82mbps and upload is 44mbps. 2) AT&amp;T; will not provision LTE advanced features such as Wi-Fi calling or advanced messaging. 3) AT&amp;T; will not recognize the IMEI in order to push secondary LTE bands and with that also throttles your bandwidth...I use my phone heavily for work and require high bandwidth speeds for presentations, collaboration and other internet hog programs and therefore this specific model phone will not work for me and thought I should let everyone know what I'm experiencing. You can kind of somewhat band-aid fix some of the above issues by rooting your phone and loading custom firmware and ROMs but if I did that I could no longer user it for my job and therefore the phone is useless to me.....I love everything else about the phone including the gold color and am sad to have to send it back and go buy a dang AT&amp;T; branded one..",10
5,the cost was very good in comparison to others i looked at and considered,"January 6, 2018",1,"The shipping was fast, the cost was very good in comparison to others i looked at and considered, the phone is AMAZING!!! Iâ€™m actually in the Caribbean and it works like a dream. I bought it for my daughterâ€™s 16th birthday and will buy another for myself once I have the funds seeing that the exchange rate is almost 3-1... making it $2400 my currency. All in all an incredible purchase sheâ€™s beyond happy and is still thanking me and hugging me and Iâ€™m happy with it as well!  The picture quality on this thing is out of this world",3
3,"Phone works great, and for the price is shouldn't be surprised ...","January 13, 2018",1,"Phone works great, and for the price is shouldn't be surprised that the phone i received was a Chinese model. Giving it three stars do to the fact that this was no where on the page's description. Although it said it was an internation version, not sure why the box was covered in Chinese.",4
3,The phone itself is very nice but my problem was with signal strength,"February 9, 2018",1,The phone itself is very nice but my problem was with signal strength.... Using both t-mobile and att Sims the signal was very poor compared to even the dual Sim blackberry keyone I have. Service would cut in and out like crazy on the note 8 on both Sims where as the keyone would have either 2-3 bars of lte...Unfortunately the phone had to be returned...,1
4,Best phone for 2017 and beyond,"February 23, 2018",1,"Had it for a couple hours and i absolutely love this. It came as described. Brand new sealed and all. The transition into this 18.5/9 ratio is quick after messing with settings, it made the phone even better from using gestures to get around and get the most out of the devics. This thing is fast and snappy, after changing a few settings and adding my fave launcher omg nothing can slow this down(for now). Theres only 2 things that im not entirely sold on. 1) on the back there is a DUOS branding(its not that bad but still takes away from the astetic. 2) this one is not entirely about the phone but more of the accessories it came with, since this is the international model it has a Europe charger but they did provide an adapter but it just makes the charger even more bulky.",0

5,both ZDNet and Forbes reviewers said it was the best phone for business use compared to the IphoneX,"November 22, 2017",0,"I had held off buying this phone because of some reviews on the battery life. However, both ZDNet and Forbes reviewers said it was the best phone for business use compared to the IphoneX. My phone company gave me a 50% off deal and so I bought. Glad I did! The battery life has been great. I easily get through a 24 hour period with no more than 75% of the battery life used up. On light days I can get 48 hours of use before hitting the 25% left notice. Don't listen to those people saying they only get 4 hours. The only people getting that kind of result are doing a lot of streaming and game playing and there is no phone out there that will go more than 4 or 5 hours doing that. The Spen has become a good business tool for me and I'm now doing business on the phone I used to reserve for my desktop.

I purchased this sold and shipped by Amazon (not third party) and received a brand new model SM-N950F phone. Given how delicate the phone is, warranty is important to me. While I was informed it would be covered by Samsung's 1 year warranty even with it being an international model because I purchased it from an authorized USA dealer (sold and shipped by Amazon),  I ended up returning it. Why? While Samsung support will say the phone will be covered under warranty, in practice you won't be able to get it service as the Samsung repair centers won't touch international model phones. Call the actual Samsung phone service centers and ask. It sort of makes sense since they won't have all the same parts the international models have. If you can live with the risk of no warranty and it not being serviceable in the USA by Samsung repair centers, it's a fine phone.",3

Every app you download has its own cloud storage, every app has a monthly subscription and registration, if you donâ€™t sign up and pay you will be bombarded with ads, each of these apps wants access to your entire phone like contacts, pictures, camera, microphone; otherwise you cannot even install the app, there is no privacy like on iPhone, i was absolutely horrified when I tried this thing, absolutely appalling, and customer service is absolute and utter garbage...Happily went back to iPhone and will never even dare trying android ever again, this phone costs as much as iPhone but processor is 2 generations older than iPhonesâ€™s, even an old iPhone beats this phone in multitasking, encoding video, 4K 60fps video, image quality, this phone is garbage.....",15

5,Best Phone currently on the Market - Includes International Version Details,"March 30, 2016",1,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago...A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging...This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers...To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine...Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm)...The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram...Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:.- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher..- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements..- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off...Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge...Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera...Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance...Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)..A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything..",578
1,I bought the phone in April 2016 and worked perfect until October of that year when it started to ...,"January 26, 2017",1,"I bought the phone in April 2016 and worked perfect until October of that year when it started to restart itself and every time, and VERY HOT. There are days when I just can not use it and many others work fine. I contacted Amazon and they told me that it was out of the 30 day warranty but that IÂ¨ll should go to a Samsun Center for the 1 year warranty. I did it and as I live in Ecuador, South America, I took it to the authorized center and they told me that the problem should be that it has to be update, it but they could not do it because the phone is from Egypt !! And that only in the place of origin it can be done!!.So when they buy a phone notice of which zone it is..Sold by: Wireless Place...Now in March 2017 the  cell phone stopped working. For having been bought on Amazon it  had no Samsung warranty and as the damage occurred after the first 3 months, Amazon also did not take responsibility. I lost the $ 750 that it cost me before a year of use..I will never bought a mobile phone in Amazon again..",103
1,Fine Print Fiasco,"August 19, 2016",1,"I purchased this phone for the expressed purpose of developing VR projects for Gear VR and Google Cardboard. I never expected or intended to use the phone features of the device. So I never added a SIM card much less carried it around or away from my office. After a couple of weeks the OS seemed to have crapped out and got itself stuck on some green terminal looking boot screen. Despite all my attempts to force a restart, perform a system restore, drain/charge the battery or whatever Android lets you do by holding in button X while closing one eye and whistling a happy tune, the phone just won't get past that Bootloader exception screen...I'm not an Android guy and since the purpose of the phone was to test apps, the device was required to be as close to stock as possible to adequately replicate the experience someone might have on their own device. By that I mean I didn't ""root"" the phone or mess with the OS beyond letting Android run all those auto updates it seems to do on a daily basis...I contacted Samsung US support and they said my phone didn't exist as far as they were concerned because it was obviously an international device. They told me to determine the country of origin and arrange service there...How convenient...I looked for some type of local resource that can service phones but it appears all that can be done are screen or battery replacements. Anything heavier has to go to the manufacturer...in Spain...or Antartica...or the Moon...I contacted the Amazon Marketplace vendor (Mobiles International LLC) that I purchased the phone from and they we nice enough in their correspondence and said:..""Unfortunately Samsung does not provide warranty service on international unlocked phones. If you sent it to us in Miami, we can get a quote from a Samsung authorized service center to get the phone repaired. It looks like a software issue and should be fixable.""..I FedEx'd them the phone and waited and waited. After two weeks or so I sent them an email wondering if there was any update...""At this time we have not received a quote unfortunately, the Samsung repair center here cannot repair your device because it is not Latin. We have one other option that we are trying. We will contact you as soon as we get a response.""..And waited and waited...till about a month and half had passed and got this:..""We received the unit back from Samsung this week. They returned the unit saying the warranty was void. We have shipped back to your address yesterday.""..Huh? Is Samsung saying that I dropped it in a toilet? Or that I used my considerable phone hacking skills to circumvent their awesome software and install my own custom OS? No idea...So the lesson being, read the fine print. International unlocked phones may or may NOT come with a warranty. And even if you work yourself past that little detail and decide to roll the dice...if something goes wrong with your device there appears to be no recourse to have it repaired...Even if you expect to pay for said repair because the assumption being that a repair would cost less than the cost of a new phone there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to facilitate getting it fixed. Waiting weeks and weeks to get some vague note about the warranty being void is hardly a workable solution..",369

4,What are my thoughts of this phone now that I have owned it for three months?,"January 7, 2017",1,"This review is not about the performance of the phone itself, which you can check online with many reputable phone reviewers. This review is about my experience in buying an international version through this seller as opposed to through a carrier as most mobile phone consumers do in the US. Now that I have a chance to use it for close to three months, I can say that it is safe to buy this phone as I had doubt before buying it. It is an international version sold in Asian countries and works as advertised. I love it because it supports dual SIMs and is in gold color, both of which are not available in the US market where I live. The phone works just like any new Samsung Galaxy phone thus far and I am impressed with Samsung's quality. Just so you know, I had the Note 7 prior to this phone and no phone can beat the Note 7, so it was a shame that it was recalled...Here is the summary of my review for this international version of the Galaxy S7 Edge:.Pros:.- Same quality as the US versions.- Unlocked (can be used with any GSM carriers).- Dual SIMs support (or 1 SIM 1 micro flash memory).- Much cheaper then its US counterparts..Cons:.- No warranty (this is a gamble you would have to take). Samsung US will not help you if you ran into issues.- The seal of the box was broken, but nothing seems to have been missing. Not sure why that is.- The charger's plug is not compatible with the US outlets, you will need to get an adapter. I thought his version uses the the US style but I was wrong.....",2

I email and escalate the situation direct to their absolute help center at with no any success, as Samsung is not responsible even when they can see phone was made by them. Sad that no one seems to care about to help with the issue, but at moment of purchase you get so much hype about how wonderful the product and warranty is, in this case I enjoy this phone for $2.40 per day.

My Galaxy 5-5-6 are in the hands of my wife and kids and run as good as the day of original purchase. Now for my 7 Edge is the easiest to set-up and the feel and ease of use is totally incredible. It's making my laptop obsolete. I pay my bills and make all my eBay and Amazon purchases using my cellphone. S7 has so many features its insane. I'll continue to use the S7 until the S9 comes along.

Trust me if the battery was charged 100% with in no time it starts loosing its juice even if you dont talk or browse or watch movies or listen to music...These are quite a few issue i can say.

4,"Just terrible experience with Samsung, but excellent one with Amazon, which reimbursed in full 6 month after purchase","December 26, 2016",1,"Just terrible experience with this. In a couple of months USB slot stopped working, so I could only charge it wirelessly. Then the device started warming up sometimes to a point it was difficult to hold it in your hand, and then going into restart cycles. I contacted the seller and was told they only provide 30 days return policy, which is reasonable. What I was shocked about is when I contacted Samsung support I was told they can't help me with an international version and I have to contact the seller. They basically refused to be liable for the product they manufactured. I had to buy another phone and have a useless piece of technology worth $600 at home, don't know what to do with it. Will probably have to throw it away eventually. The repair shops say to get to the USB slot they have to remove the screen which according to Samsung manual can't be removed without damaging it, so they give me 50/50 chance they can remove it without cracking. But since now it's completely unusable may be I could give it a try...Update: After a short chat with Amazon six months after I purchased this item, I was reimbursed in full. Reimbursement was provided by Amazon, which in fact had little to do with this situation, since it was an independent seller and initially there were clear warnings it was an international version without warranty. 8 stars to Amazon and 0 to Samsung, which gives 4 on the average....",11

I bought this phone from a seller named 'lifeline###' and the box the phone came in had the factory seal.  As another reviewer pointed out, my phone originated from the United Arab Emirates so this came with a non-US friendly charge adapter and the manual appears to be in English &amp; Arabic.  In any case, the phone is great working order and I was able to just pop in my T-Mobile SIM card with no configuration needed, nor a visit to the T-Mobile store!..I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 so all I had was the regular charging block which doesn't support the fast charge.

I received a 'United Arab Emirates' version. It is unlocked and works perfectly with my Cricket service, (AT&amp;T; network)..  One big plus I noticed is network connection speed, on my previous phone, a Xperia Z3+ it was ok but could have been better, and I thought it was just my general location and the fact I am on Cricket which piggybacks on AT&amp;T.; With the S7 Edge connection is noticeably quicker and using a speed test app my download speeds are consistently @ 7-8Mbps with even just 1 bar signal 4G LTE, Crickets' throttled limit. Signal reception is also stronger on the S7 Edge in my home than any phone I have had before and I have had quite a few, (H+ and 4G LTE)..  It is physically smaller than an iPhone 6s Plus I tried for a short period but it has the same display size, and It's a lot easier to operate 1 handed the the large iPhone..  So far, (after 10 days of heavy use), I like it better every day as it keeps on performing even as I install and use my many apps. The Nougat upgrade has been available for a few days already and I will be upgrading it soon. I will update my review after upgrading to Nougat...**Update** I installed the Nougat update yesterday, (02-21-17). No issues installing, I just let it do it's thing and it took probably 20-30min. Everything works as it should and it has lots of new features, still discovering some of them. No issues so far. I would say it is as fast and smooth as it was before the update if not better.  I'm really liking the blue light filter option to reduce eye strain. This phone is still performing and I still like it better than the day I got it!..",3

They said it must have been damaged during shipping and came unsealed because it is from Latin market. Fishy..Apart from that, phone itself is really good ( could be because it's my frst flagship phone). Camera is top notch, specially the low light capabilities. Beats iPhone 6s with ease..Edge Display with AMOLED screen is beautiful..Glass design on front and back is good but is not meant for clumsy hands or oily fingers. With a good protective case (which sort of kills the overall look of the phone) the issue of shattering the glass and fingerprint smudges is taken care of to a certain extend..All in all, I am happy that I bought this over OnePlus 3t. I am not saying latter is not a good phone; I am sure it must be great, but for me Samsung proved above and beyond my expectations. No complaints so far..",1

Only calls, messaging, camera and sometimes internet.  It started heating, I took this for normal till it was so hot that I could not even hold it, and the system would crash.  I tried several times by resetting it to factory standards, but all the same it would keep on heating and crashing.  All this happened in 3 months. I finally contacted Samsung in US during December and they told me that it is an International version, thus they could not offer warranty.  I tried to return it to Amazon Wireless and they said they would not take it back because this was after the one month period, and said the manufacturer should offer the warranty.  Conclusion:  I paid $ 617 for an fantastic smart phone which only lasted four months and during which I have only had problems.  Neither Samsung nor Amazon has offered me a refund.

I did try to get it to the factory setting - by flashing the latest firmware on it - but amazingly since it is an international version, the samsung web ste doesnt allow to download its firmware. (It only permits download of american model firmware from usa IP address)...Next I tried Samsung smart switch tool (which is hardly smart actually). The tool itself says cant flash because can not reach site - which site no one knows - and yes the mac is properly connected to the internet...The only way to get it to work is to get into master boot mode - and do a factory reset.  but that will only work as long as you prevent it from applying updates (i think it updates with incompatible american version software)...Big mistake.

1,Samsung Customer service could quite possibly be the worst on the planet.,"August 11, 2016",1,I love the phone when it was working. Since it is an unlocked device no one seems to want to take responsibility for repairing it under warranty. I am having the famous grey line problem which seems to be a pretty wide spread problem with this phone...Samsung customer service is terrible. I have spent hours trying to find a way to get my device serviced and keep getting told to call someone else or someone will call me back in 24 to 48 hours and no one ever calls back...For Samsung customer service alone I will not buy another Samsung device ever again.....,11

5,Quite Simply The Best Phone I've Ever Owned,"August 31, 2016",1,"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco.  The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market.  A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug.  While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters.  Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy...Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it.  I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year.  I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface.  Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable.  It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result...The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power.  It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day.  That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat.  The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome...Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully.  Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment.  One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity.  no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise...I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions.  From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality...For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured.  I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal.  The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product...If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour.  The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge...If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour:  Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset.  It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine.  This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake...",2

5,"Great Phone, at a Great Price","March 9, 2017",1,"We are on MetroPCS.  While this is an international version of the phone, it works extremely well.  We have no issues with service what so ever.  My husband set up the phones before taking them in to get the sim cards switched over.  Both had a direct update from Samsung to Android 7.0 that had to be downloaded, and installed.  On Wifi the download was very quick, and it was all done and installed in less than 30 minutes.  Gorgeous phone with glass front and back, and while my husband finds the edge apps annoying i love them.  I think its just the way he holds the phone.  We both love the battery life.  He is into an online only game, and now he can play through his 4 accounts and still has over 65% battery life left and that is going on them multiple times a day.  I have my wifi and data on all the time, and my phone has serious use through the day, and i have usually about 45% battery life left at the end of the day...We purchased the actual Samsung portable chargers for this, the little circles you just lay your phone on, and don't have to plug in the mini usb cord.  They work great, and charge the phones as expected...Overall this is my 3rd Samsung product and i am not at all disappointed...",0

It is authentic 100% Samsung s7 edge. I would recommend buying this phone. Only downside the charger needed a adapter so I'm using the USB cord alone with  my old charger head.,5

With one charge it'll last me all day, while on the other phone I had to recharged it when I got home from work..The graphics are amazing and I haven't had any glitches or problems with the phone so far..I did buy a screen protector and phone case since I seem to break phones quite easy..The screen itself seems to be scratch resistant..As for water resistant I can't say anything since I haven't used my phone in the water, I don't feel confident enough to drop my phone in the water or have it in the shower..This is so far the best phone I've owned, it does not heat up as bad as my other phone and it has an elegant view....",2

Samsung did it pretty good this time, for sure. The product came with an adapter for if you want to use it in the US. Another important feature is that you can still use this in the US and have the 4G compatibility, the only thing that you are going to miss it is the processor as the other US version has a better processor using the snapdragon 820.

5,Awesome Phone!!,"September 17, 2016",1,"I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version..I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures..I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast..I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all..My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that..I will update my review in the future if anything changes...UPDATE:.I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use..I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive..I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive..I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges..Overall I would definitely recommend this phone.....",1

But be aware of the following caveats that come in addition to the seller's fine print in the description: Samsung Pay will most likely NOT work out the box*, you won't get WiFi calling or voice over LTE,  and also this version of the phone doesn't support the latest and greatest wireless protocol (4x4 MIMO which T-Mobile has deployed), though it's still pretty fast...*Samsung Pay can be side loaded on certain international versions depending on the original market they were intended for, such as Germany, Spain, or the UAE. There's no guarantee your phone will be from any of those regions. Mine was from Trinidad/South America...",0

5,"Great phone, Seller was just fine!","August 1, 2016",1,"This phone is by far one of the best on the market. After reading the reviews left by some of the buyers, there seems to be some confusion on what seller to buy it from. My phone, which is real, and came factory sealed, was bought from ""The Coos"". However, to my understanding, there is no one out there making fake edge phones. The phone is just too complex to duplicate. What might be happening is the phones could possibly be getting damaged during the shipping process. The phone is glass, so if the shipper isn't packaging it correctly, it could absolutely take on damage. This is why I recommend, that if you are planning on buying this phone from amazon, make sure amazon is the one fulfilling the order. I have had no problems at all when I order from a third party that allows amazon to fulfill the order. Also, it doesn't hurt to review the customer reviews on the actual seller as well..As far as the phone itself goes, it works perfectly. All the specs pretty much define what to expect from the phone. It's got the best screen in the world and the best camera. The glass finish makes it beautiful, but it's fingerprint prone and and extremely slippery. Other than that, I have no complaints..",7

2,No Samsung Pay on International model,"August 5, 2016",1,"EDIT: So after owning this for a few months, I'm dropping the rating solely because of the Edge touch screen. The fact is that I find it very annoying to use. The side of your hand touches it really easily, and it it makes typing or playing games on the phone very frustrating. The edge apps themselves are very few and far between and not that useful either. It's a pity since the phone itself is great, runs programs well, has great visuals and camera but actually using the thing is just frustrating. I'd suggest getting just the S7 to save yourself some money and comfort...The phone that arrived is the genuine article and works great--I'm thrilled with how well the battery and fast charging works even when playing Pokemon Go all the time. Also, I have T-Mobile and the phone works perfectly fine...However, even though the app is on your phone, the international model is not compatible with Samsung Pay. If you want that you need to get the American version of the phone. I wish I'd known this, but to me it was worth the savings in price and you can still use Android Pay. But I didn't realize this before buying it and I would have liked to have known.....",1

5,A mostly positive and detailed review.,"August 6, 2017",1,"BEWARE!.99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION!..After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)..Pro's:.1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone..2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8).3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it..4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it..5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple..6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here..7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone..8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour..9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+..10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds..11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone..12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers..13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets...Neutral:.1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions..2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect..3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it..4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it..5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs..6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read...Con's:.1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness..2. ""Ok Google"". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change..3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood)..4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button...On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know...As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot!..Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways...Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading.","1,623"
5,So far the best phone I ever had,"August 29, 2017",1,"<div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-R2WZC5YWPVPEWB""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1zegBnFbbS.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TjXuWgH5S.png""/>Â So far the best phone I ever had. Man it's beautiful. Sleek design and powerful hardware. I did a comparison with my old phone and you certainly can feel that it's more powerful. I'm not used to it yet. But it does everything perfectly. The picture quality is superb. I love shooting video and it nails it in video quality and it does slow motion!! say whaaaat!! But sometimes it overheats under the direct sun when I record video but I think that is normal. I don't use the fingerprint sensor only because I can't find it. And the mono speaker under the phone is a downside which most of the time I cover it with my little finger and it's kinda annoying. Other than that it's freaking fast and top notch phone. I don't regret buying it ..Make sure to check out the video and pictures and if my review was helpful please press YES for helpful. Thank you.",234
5,"Great phone, activate yourself","August 28, 2017",1,"I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network.  My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  It takes just 5-10 minutes.  Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  Other than that the actual phone is great.  Very sleek looking phone.  This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.",94
3,"Gorgeous hardware, same old Sammy.","August 1, 2017",1,"This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one...Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions...",172
4,"As of this Review, this is the best phone on the Market","August 18, 2017",1,"I haven't owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus..I've always felt that Samsung's Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish...This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20..I really liked the LG V20 for it's cameras and the Axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3T.were so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8...I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me..The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands..I don't think I will go back to a 6"" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too...Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled..I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc...Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can't go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I'm using Face Unlock, it's really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven't tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock..They should move the camera to the corner like some phones...USB-C is awesome..Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though)...I have a few gripes..Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos..My other gripe is the single speaker. C'mon... it's 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers..Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist...By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it...This phone has tons of other features too, but I'm not going to list them all. Overall, it's the best smart phone I've ever owned. Hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years..",44
5,"It Is a Nice Phone,  a Glorified S7 In a Good Way","October 8, 2017",1,"1.- I bought the ""Phone Only"", this Amazon description makes it look or sound like you are buying a phone on a plastic bag or something,  but it comes in a nice box, with AWG (?) headphones, a pair of extra ear plugs, wall charger with USB cable, a USB adapter and a tool to pop up the phones SD/SIM card comparment...2.- A regular USB micro cable will not fit, but it comes with an adapter...It feels really good in my hand, I bought a Zizo Bolt case that comes with a glass protector.(see pics)..More to come later , but I'm a Samsung guy, so I know what to expect, but I'll post an update once i get to use it a little bit more..",30
1,Really bad service from Samsung. Front camera was defective.,"October 15, 2017",1,"Really bad service from Samsung. The phone came with a defect in the front camera. I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I  could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy..I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me ""Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back""..So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business?..I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase..",68
5,One of the best phones out there.,"November 14, 2017",1,"This phone is dope, it looks cool and it feels cool. Some people dont like where the finger print scanner is located but I dont really mind, I got used to it in a day but thats just me. This is one of the best phones I've had, its really fast and you can customize everything!..One thing I would like to point out, wich I havent seen any other reviewer talk about, is that when I put my SIM card inside the S8 it dint activate my LTE service, so this is what I did, grab another phone that has a SIM card from your same carrier and copy that phones VPN setting to your S8, it worked for me...Id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but I have a friend that has had her S8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance...Edit: I added some pictures of what I did with the VPN, you just have to manually copy the information from another cell phone to your S8, hope this helps..Ps.My friend dropped her phone a few days ago lol, buy a case..",7
5,Plain and Simple review.,"November 21, 2017",1,"Im not going to get into huge detail here, but I love this phone...The Camera is amazing.The screen is amazing.The fingerprint scanner works better than everyone says it does..I have taken this phone in the shower with me multiple times. 0 problems..it played music underwater (not recommended) with 0 problems..It does take a little getting used to, but the longer I have it, the more I love it..Honestly I can't think of one thing I don't like.except that I wish the bixby button was programmable...And I would recommend the otterbox Defender series case. Ive had it for weeks and it has been incredible..",7
4,Works great with Verizon!,"September 2, 2017",1,"The good: I'm really glad that I got this over spending more for a Verizon phone. There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures...The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level)..",5
1,"Can't disable ""personal assistant""","November 7, 2017",1,"So, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. But, I constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that I have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something...""But why don't you just disable it?"" you might say. Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable...So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. But take it from me, save yourself. Get a different phone now.",13
5,I do not regret buying!,"September 9, 2017",1,"I didn't think much of this phone as I was waiting for the Note 8. (Was a Note 4 user just 2 days before) But as the Note 8 became more disappointing with each leak, and esspecially after it's release with no embedded fingerprint scanner and a smaller battery than the S8+, I decided to look at the S8+. It was cheaper, has the same features as the Note 8 and, I believe it's safe to say, a better battery life. It was clear that this phone was next on the throne. While I wouldn't have the pen, I had to admit to myself that I hardly used the pen for the Note 4 anyway. No real loss there, so I ended up saving myself a few hundred bucks...As for the phone itself, I am very impressed. The display is so beautiful- especially with the infinity display. Textures look almost too real and the colors are so sharp and eye pleasing. Even in videos... I was also impressed with the battery life. Throughout the day I used the Note 4 and S8+ fairly equally and to my surprise, from 9am to 3pm the S8+ left me with 70% from 100% while my Note 4 had to be charged again from 100%...Customization is a must for me with any phone and this phone has outdone my expectation for any phone. Of course it has the basic customizations, but this phone goes so deep into it that I still haven't been able to see all that you can do with it after 2 days of use when I usually go through everything on a phone within a day...No phone is perfect and there's usually at least one thing I won't like about a phone. The ONLY thing I don't like about this phone is the placement of the speaker. It's located at the bottom of the phone in the right side, and that's a problem because I'm a gamer and I occasionally watch YouTube which I preferably use in landscape mode which requires that you turn the phone horizontally. When I hold the phone naturally in that position, I end up covering the speaker which forces me to readjust my grip to a more uncomfortable one...That being said, this phone is still the best one I could have purchased at this time and I do NOT regret buying it whatsoever..",4
4,"Worthy addition to the Galaxy S line, a good choice","December 14, 2017",1,"Great phone, first unlocked we've ever bought, and it was a great move.  It's great but not perfect...PROS.Excellent performance with all apps, very snappy.Beautiful screen (though very delicate).Light, great battery life..CONS.* Phone is slippery wherever you touch/grab it.  Hard to hold onto, unless you get a case, which you probably should..* Bixby assistant is very obtrusive and even has its own dedicated hard button on the left, which you will be mistakenly hitting often (you can sign into Samsung and set the button to do nothing, but you can't seem to reassign the button to be useful, or completely get rid of Bixby)..* Edge screen design is a novelty and more difficult to use than a standard screen.  I find myself having to try multiple times to get the right thing selected with my finger, because of the wrapping edges of the screen.* Doesn't seem to have a widget for flashlight built in, like my S5 had.",3
5,Works on Sprint Network,"August 25, 2017",1,"This phone was rated as ""good"" from warehouse deals. When it arrived it was in the factory box and looked like it had never been opened.  The plastic was still on the screen. I found no scratches or imperfections. My carrier is Sprint. It is truly unlocked for all carriers.They had me hooked up in about 15 minutes. The clerk asked me if i had bought the phone new from Samsung directly. He told me it was the unlocked version that would work internationally too.I have had the phone a couple of weeks and it has performed flawlessly. This was another great buy for me here on Amazon. If you are on the fence like I was about upgrading to the S8, go ahead and buy one here, its just an awesome phone. I had an S5 that was great but this S8 is so much better. Trust me on this. Go ahead and buy it. You will be amazed too!",10
5,Better value than the Note8,"October 26, 2017",1,"I waited until recently to purchase the S8+ as my original intention was to get the Note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted Note 7). However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper..So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward.  I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone..I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box..All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!..",2
5,The screen is breath taking,"October 4, 2017",1,"After using an old phone with such a large bezel, the switch to the Galaxy S8 was spectacular. I could not stop staring at the screen when I first saw it. There is just so much of it! After using this phone for a couple months, I have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product...Pros:.-Screen has amazing brightness, resolution and size..-Cameras are spectacular. Images are sharp and crisp..-Opposed to contrary belief, the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive.-Battery life is very good, also charges very quickly with the included Fast Charger.-Has Video Enhancement and Game Enhancement modes for when you need extra brightness, performance and screen resolution...Cons:.-Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case).-Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case).-Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential...Overall great phone and great experience so far. Would Recommend!.",3
5,This is the Phone of the Decade,"January 25, 2018",1,"I am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price...Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8"" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure.  The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung's ""Infinity Display"". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they've introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)..Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung's 'controversial' TouchWiz skin. However, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It's responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month...Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that's offered. With my iPhone, I've always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I've downloaded many things that I previously couldn't and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It's also IP68 certified dust and water resistant...Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone...Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear...Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work...Voice Command: Samsung has added a new 'Bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby 'levels'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps...Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn't trade it for anything else really. This is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. If you're holding out, don't wait! It's an experience unlike any other...NOTE: I have covered the broad specs of the S8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on Samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information..",2
1,Great hardware but two things that make it terrible,"January 22, 2018",1,"Great hardware but two things that make it terrible. Software especially phone dailer is terrible compared to stock android. You have to have a separate app just to check your voicemail with the S8 vs a Pixel where it is included with the dailer and a breeze to use. It may not sound like much but spending extra time going to that app wastes a lot time over time.  Also that bixby thing is terrible.  They won't let you turn it off without a Samsung account that they use to track you.  It pops all the time but after a while you figure out how to get it to stop saying ""hello, this bixby"" and then you learn how to get it stopped right away. Once again a big waste of time but at least it becomes less of a pain.  But really, why put up with any pain when this phone costs over $600?  Skip it, keep your old phone if it still works or buy something else.",4
5,Great product. Great phone. Great company.,"November 25, 2017",1,"I have had my Galaxy S8 for a little bit now and it has been great so far! I love how fast it is. I love the little things about it. The screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio. The fingerprint scanner is great and I know majority don't like the position but for me it works amazing. It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video. Honestly, I know I am bias towards Samsung products but everything I have had and also my friends/family have are amazing. They made great phones and appliances. Everything they make is top of the line and that's just the truth.",3
4,The literal definition of a glass cannon,"August 22, 2017",1,"First let me get this out of the way: This phone for the most part is awesome. The specs are beastly, the camera is among the best in class, the 1440p bezel-less curved display looks amazing, and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage. But while this phone is objectively one of the best out right now, it is also one of the most fragile. The backglass on mine broke within a week of usage and I actually had to replace the backglass in order to fix this. To put it in context, the only other phone glass that I have ever broke is the iPod Touch 4th gen, and I had that for nearly 2 years of usage before that happened. This is not a durable phone in the slightest, and I would highly recommend getting a case or skin for it if you plan to get this phone. Outside of that, this is a great phone and I'd recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues",10
5,Excellent,"August 29, 2017",1,Love it...it works on my verizon sim card as well as wth my sim card from the Philippines..the camera is so clear..thanks amazon for fast and safe shipping,13
2,Verizon phone!,"January 8, 2018",1,"The phone I received from this Amazon seller is an unlocked Verizon phone.  It may or may not have been ""unlocked by Samsung"", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone.  Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types.  When I put my AT&amp;T; sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying ""not a Verizon sim card"" error message in the notification tray.  You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone.  I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung.  It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it.  For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising...1/11/2018 -  Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today.  It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined.  Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from ""Electronic Deals"" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store..",2
5,Often Imitated ... But Never Duplicated,"August 25, 2017",1,"Wifey's an Apple-Head ... I'm Team Samsung ... the debate continues.  She recently upgraded to the iPhone 7 Plus (Red Special Edition) ... &amp; it's 'nice' ... but when I received my new Galaxy S8+, I was instantaneously reminded of the style, quality &amp; excellence that only Samsung can deliver.  It's not even close...* FYI ... I purchased a Verizon Prepaid SIM Card, as a suggested add-on through Amazon after adding the phone to my Cart.  The Verizon SIM Card is a 'Verizon Wireless SIM Kit Prepaid Sim Card - (Moto G &amp; Any Verizon Branded Phone)'.  When I attempted to activate the phone w/ SIM Card through the Verizon Wireless website, the activation would not complete &amp; Verizon claimed I needed a 'Samsung' SIM Car Kit.  However, my wife completed the activation steps that accompanied the SIM Card Kit (the instructions on the packaging), &amp; the activation completed flawlessly..",3
5,"Great phone but careful, it not technically an Infinity Display.","September 20, 2017",1,"I will simply add to the ""I love it"" category but I do want to add something that might not be known. Samsung is a bit deceptive in their advertising of this phone. The infinity display is NOT really infinity. Notice they overexpose the edges on the image shown for this product. This is to hide the fact that the display does not really go from edge to edge. It goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display. It is not technically an Infinity display. That's a bit of a letdown, but not a game changer for me in saying I still love the phone. Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick, that is awesome.",2
5,Pretty and sleek,"August 1, 2017",1,"I love it.  It works like a charm.  I just wish they kept the LED notice lights where I could program the different apps and callers with as with the older versions.  You should download the Google keyboard, I kept hitting the period button instead of the space bar with the key board that it came with.",11
4,"Falls short of ""excellent"". 4 / 5","December 17, 2017",1,"I was expecting something amazing after upgrading from my old Note 4, and this falls short of my expectations. Battery life is disappointing, even with most of the apps ""sleeping"". It's the one thing that needs to be addressed and fixed - a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be OK with. I also don't really like the absence of a ""home"" button, and the Bixby button on the left side of the phone is RIDICULOUS. You think you're pressing the volume button, and instead you get the Bixby screen pop up. I've yet to use it - Google Assistant works like a charm on this phone and wakes up with ""OK Google""...On the plus side, this phone qualifies for Sprint's 1 year free unlimited bring your own phone plan...",1
1,Motherboard replaced!!!!,"February 14, 2018",1,"Read my review before make your decision!!!!!!!!!.I have purchased the S8 from this seller for around 5 months only. I have never dropped the device, never done any physical damage to the device, never done anything to the operating system. Then when I was using the cellphone for fun, suddenly it shows an problem: Device Storage Corrupted..Therefore, considering this device is still under US one-year warranty, as the seller states in the product description, I contacted Samsung service and sent the S8 to repair. However, Samsung repair center told me that the motherboard of this device is replaced, therefore, it is out of warranty... I am not sure if the seller has an explanation on this?..If not, I can only suspect that the seller has done something to the device. Then Do not buy anything from the seller! It will not be under the warranty if there is any problem!!! The Samsung would say it is not from official sellers, they won't be responsible for it!!!..",3
1,Horrible Connectivity Issues,"November 28, 2017",1,"Was supposed to be unlocked and compatible with cellular/data programs offered by, among other major providers, Verizon.  Well, it wasn't.  Finally took it to a Verizon store and was told that the phone was simply not compatible with Verizon. So Frustrating! It's so obvious the answer is the best course of action is to go to a provider brick and mortar store (in this case Verizon), and buy the phone there.  Whatever the difference in price is, if any, is more than offset by the time and hassle saved. Ugh!",3
3,Great specced phone with some major drawbacks,"December 1, 2017",1,"I have had this phone for several months now...This phone has great specs and does not fail in that regard. It also contains many of the features expected of flagship phones such as waterproofing and wireless charging..With that said, I had 3 concerns when initially purchasing this phone after coming from a Nexus 6P...1. Phone updates, including upgrades to new versions of Android..2. Non-stock experience, including many Samsung apps already installed..3. Single bottom firing speaker...With that said, the first issue is still a concern. Updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android. This is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another Samsung phone again..The second issue has been less of a concern for me. Many of the Samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock Android. They are very usable and are worth giving a try..The third issue is still and issue, but some people have been able to enable stereo functionality, but will require rooting the phone. The speaker is loud, but stereo audio sounds much better...",1

3,This is a good phone with some major issues,"November 29, 2017",1,"This is a good phone with some major issues..First good:.--Very nice display and good sound.--Good camera, especially in low light..--Looks really good...Now to the bad:.--Some of the applications that used to run before without problems, now take huge resources and stop working, e.g. requires rebooting the phone every time I want to use Amazon Prime Video..--Display while good is fingerprint and dust magnet and all these things reflect in sunlight making viewing experience less than optimal, to put it mildly..--It may be T-Mobile specific but data connection settings do not include both 4th and 6th standards for the network, so I had to create my own setting for it.-- The biggest thing the phone front camera and back flash (as well as all camera software) stopped working after only two months. After analyzing the issue (Samsung has internal hardware checking menu), I found out that it was hardware issue. It was confirmed and fixed by Samsung center in Manhattan (Guys at ""Samsung 837"" are great. If anyone lives in NYC Metro area, you should visit Samsung 837: great service, great experience and they do not try to sell, they just show the products and explain).",1
5,Fantastic speeds!,"January 12, 2018",1,"I ordered this on Black Friday and after waiting a few weeks it arrived. I didn't expect to actually enjoy an Android based phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. My carrier fully supports this phone and I consistently get maximum speeds in my city (150/20). At home I get gigabit wifi. It was a little weird to look at the curved sides, but I got used to it after about 2 days. I highly recommend the OtterBox Defender case because this phone, like many others, is a bit too thin for large hands.",1
2,I did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro SD card (which is allowed with this device) and it worked fine ever since I bought it,"February 12, 2018",1,"I did buy this phone NEW and FROM Amazon just FYI.Now I know the quality of the product has nothing to do with Amazon so this rating is obviously for the product specifically..I even noticed that someone had the same problem with the phone that I did..It completely died after owning it for about 3 months. I did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro SD card (which is allowed with this device) and it worked fine ever since I bought it..However Amazons warranty is not so great. Samsung does offer a 1 year manufacturers warranty on NEW items. The CSR (Customer Support Representative) was helpful and straight forward. You do have to ship the phone to them, but they will email you a paid for shipping label (Print 3 to place on 3 sides of the box). Excluding the shipping time, maintenance and processing will take 9-11 business days. Obviously no one should have to deal with this in the first place, but I just want a helpful review if someone has a bad situation happen to them like I did. Samsung's CSR is 866-371-9501. Follow the menu prompts and you will get the option to speak to a CSR (it can get annoying waiting through all the options but you'll get there)..",1
5,Really a great Smart Phone,"October 22, 2017",1,"The screen is incredible.  One of the best Android phones out there if not the best.  Camera is great in low light situations.  Battery life is good and lasts me the whole day.  Also has a quick charging feature if you use supported Qualcomm quick charge adapters.  Only thing that annoys me is the Bixby feature.  I basically have disabled it and switched over to the Google Assistant.  Default Samsung applications for basic smart phone use are very good and minimalistic.  For example the calendaring, contacts, and messaging apps all support the basic needed functionality well.  Best thing though is the screen when you are watching HighDef video content or viewing your photos.  Really clear when you've got the right content.",0
2,Avoid and wait it out until Pixel 3 comes out,"November 4, 2017",1,"If you consider purchasing Galaxy S7, S8, or Note 8 then you should read this review first. You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market. Some of it is true, but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don't discuss on their channel. Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android. The most important is constantly getting security updates, there are two major bugs that recently shake the smartphone industry, ""KRACK (Wi-Fi Bug)"" &amp; ""BLUEBORNE (Bluetooth Bug)"" every single devices were affected including Apple devices. That said, Google (Nexus and Pixel) and Apple already patched their respective devices, but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack. May be, you own a business and getting a device to run your business and would carry all the important documents, bank information, or any business related information, your information is at risk...Samsung has come a long way from their Galaxy S4 and Note 3 days, their software is much better now, but it is no where near close to Google's Pure Android that is currently being used on Nexus and Pixel. Samsung Experience/Touchwiz is bloated with unnecessary features and apps that runs in the background and eats up the battery. I have seen much better software experience on Google Pixel, and some other devices from Motorola and Sony. Some people love the Samsung's extra features and use them often, but others don't prefer and want something that is constantly being updated with security measures. There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience (former Touchwiz); I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all, and doesn't hinder day to day use, but they are there. Samsung needs to streamline the experience, and curate it towards what consumers really want and prefer. I do not recommend this device...If you have the device that is working perfectly fine, I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1.

But you don't see any performance improvement compared to Snapdragon 820 processor based phones..Always check the seller before placing the order..Pros:.Sleek, beautiful phone..Great camera, screen, battery life and call quality..Cons:.I am not getting any notification in my fitbit charge 2 even after enabling all available permission for the app / phone factory reset. I think samsung want to promote their Wearables. I can give 5 stars if samsung fix this issue..Full glass body. Handle carefully..Lot of bloatwares with the phone. But you can disable the apps..Awkward position of fingerprint reader..",2
5,Never going back to iPhone,"August 7, 2017",1,"Been an iPhone user since the 4, up until this baby came into my life. Initially I was scared to take the leap but I'm glad I did. The s8 is the most beautiful phone I've come across and I'm so happy that it's mine. It does everything I need and more. If you're thinking about switching to Android, this is the sign for you to take that leap...Fast shipping &amp; perfect condition! All I had to do to activate mine (w Verizon) was transfer my sim card from my 6+ to the s8 and voila! I'm a very happy girl with my new s8 :).",15

I am still getting used to this phone..Pros:It takes better pictures than my Iphone 6..It seems to have a better battery life (for now).You can buy your own additional memory without paying apple..Cons: Be prepared to buy yet another charger cable..You will need to download some of your apps or have to search for a new one..You will have to search for some of your photos, mine got jumbled up. I didn't lose them but I couldn't find them too easily..",1
5,Works on Verizon,"October 24, 2017",1,"I've only had the phone for a few hours, but I can confirm that it CAN be activated on Verizon.  I bought 2 phones, went into my local store to get one of them activated.  The clerk provided a SIM card and got it running in just a few minutes (but be prepared to spend two or three hours reloading your apps and configuring the phone's options)...Waited to set up my second phone until my wife got home this evening.  I was planning on doing it myself online, but had a minor issue finding the right numbers on the phone itself (the online tool wasn't accepting the numbers).  I used Verizon's online chat, and the operator had it up and running in just a few minutes.  No problems..",0
5,Awesome phone.,"December 23, 2017",1,"Amazing phone. Just about every thing of this phone is better than the top end of iPhones. Better screen. More memory. Expansion slot. Better form. +Fingerprint sensor. Great iris sensor, and a good face detection. Better software controls because unlike iOS, android gives you a lot of control over so many aspects of user experience...I used to be an iPhone user for many years but finally got bored of the lackluster hardware, and being dictated what I should want from my phone. I use a standard ear phones, and expect my phone to honor my wishes..",0
5,Top of the line phone including great new features,"December 31, 2017",1,"Love the phone.  The all glass aspect and some of the reviews alarmed at first but after using it with a good case for minimal coverage but maximum protection it is all good.  The phone has great features and new technology, the screen is wonderful, videoâ€™s are a whole new experience, great speaker, good speaker just canâ€™t say enough about this wonderful product.",1
5,"Quality, quality, quality","January 26, 2018",1,"This is a sharp looking phone. It is the only phone I have ever owned, including the previous galaxies where people have inquired about it because of it's looks. The fingerprint sensor works really well for me and the face recognition is very convenient. My main downside is the software, which might be on Samsung or might be on Android. Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. One excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously. Not sure if this is a google account feature but kudos to whomever...Camera: Excellent.Battery: So far, excellent. I don't use my phone like crazy but without any battery saving mode I still have at least 30% left at the end of the day..Screen:  Really, really fantastic, though due to its wrap around nature terrifying if you drop your phone and I don't like cases.Size: I don't like big phones but this one is okay-ish.Feel: Just great and not cheap.Headphone Jack: No idea why it is on the bottom and I think it is awkward if you are using corded headphones to make calls because it changes the orientation, buttons on bottom..Tray SD: Not a fan of this tray crap. Worried about getting it jammed and placing the card correctly. The old system was much better..Bixy Button: Don't use it, no idea but it is annoying if you don't use it.Always On Display: Pretty nice but not necessary.LED Indicator: The best feature and probably one of the only reasons I am brand loyal.",0
4,I'm satisfied.,"January 20, 2018",1,"I've had a Samsungs since high school. It is just easier to use and I know how they work. I like the slickness, the volume, and the picture quality. I am a simple person and I don't generally find out everything that my new technology does but the Samsung has prompted me to do just about everything it could possibly do. Also, it being unlocked worked out. I thought it was going to be a hassle but I walked right into AT&amp;T; and they had my new phone and new service up and running within 30 minutes. Great buy in my opinion. Being a prime member was worth it in the end also because it arrived on Sunday as promised. The only thing the US post office service dropped this VERY expensive device at the door without knocking to let anyone know it was there! As opposed to UPs or FEDEX they don't bother to get you to sign. I would advice using one of the Amazon mailbox stations at the QT gas station or where ever they are closest to your location. Much safer.",1
5,The radio reception is amazing as well,"January 20, 2018",1,"Switched from an iPhone 8 plus and have not been able to put it down. Beats the iPhone in every way. The radio reception is amazing as well. That goes for the cellular, wifi, bluetooth and gps. Such an awesome phone. It just works and the battery life is amazing. Samsung has done some nice touches to android. I love how bixby can help you optimize your phone for better battery life and clear the ram and cash. The build quality of this thing is amazing. Even beats apple. I would even recommend this phone in 2018. Yeah the S9 is coming but if you don't want the latest and greatest this phone is really worth a look.",0
5,"So far, so good","November 3, 2017",1,"I bought this phone when it was on sale for $625. Great deal, based on other prices. I purchased this after my Galaxy S5 died. Coming from the S5, this is a major upgrade. The phone is beautiful, but due to my tendency to drop phones, I have it in a case. I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like ""her"" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him..Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge ""tray"" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden. I've only had the phone for less than 24 hours, but I will update the review if my opinion changes..",0
4,The phone itself works fine with great colors and reasonably fast,"December 14, 2017",1,The phone itself works fine with great colors and reasonably fast. Take excellent pictures and videos and all in all would buy it again. My biggest negative is that for some reason within two weeks of having this phone it crashed and unfortunately I had just taken about 60 pictures that day which never made it to the cloud and I lost them all. Very disappointing.,2
5,Take a look at the third party sellers first!,"August 13, 2017",1,"I don't usually leave reviews but this phone is stunning. I bought the phone through a third party seller that offered the phone with a bundle of high quality accessories. All for $40 dollars less than the listed Amazon price. I couldn't be happier with my purchase...A warning though like many other reviewers this phone is very delicate put a good case and screen protector on this phone it definitely is not meant to be naked.

The screen on this phone is amazing.  You get that amazing screen without the phone feeling bulky.  It is so thin and feels great in your hand.  The battery life is incredible and the quick charge feature is great.  Getting a screen protector on the phone was a bit different with the infinity screen, but well worth the extra effort to protect the screen.  There are a variety of cases available.",0

5,Great phone!,"January 9, 2018",1,I am extremely satisfied with this phone. Had no issues activating it with my current Verizon account. Just went to the retailer for a free SIM card and they set everything up. One thing that I wished I had known prior to purchasing this was that with an unlocked phone you will  not have voicemail notifications. This is software that is installed by carriers onto the carrier specific phones. The only way you will know if you have voicemail is to call your mailbox. There are some apps available to download so this really isn't an issue. I just wish I had known about this so I wouldnt have missed some messages.,1
1,Worst phone ever,"January 10, 2018",1,Worst phone ever. Samsung is worst service. Do not buy this/Samsung products. Software updates ruin the phone and due to purchasing via Amazon the service isn't good. It's US Warranty phone but doesn't cover the same as a store bought or direct Samsung bought.

My college has free wifi and it worked perfectly fine on my S7edge, but on my S8, it said wifi is blocked. I tried wifi in Mcdonalds, parks, restaurants, and the wifi are all blocked. What on earth? It said I should contact my phone provider or what not and I am kind of really upset.",1

Before buying the Samsung Galaxy S8 I was debating if I should get the Iphone 8 instead but Apple's strategy of releasing 3 phones a couple months apart just didn't make sense to me, it makes you think.

After changing the language for the phone and pulling the version number (SM-G950F), I determined this one to be a European version.

I sent my 2 month old phone in for repair when it stopped sending texts after a security update, and it was supposedly repaired but is still not working! Tech support and Sales pointed fingers at one another and have given me the runaround and refused a refund. Hard to believe Samsung hasn't improved their customer support after the S7 debacle. So far I've wasted hundreds of dollars on a paperweight and hours of my time on the phone with Samsung.

There were some annoying quirks with the youtube app..The fingerprint reader is the worst I've used yet, it always took at least 3 or 4 tries every time I got my phone out.  Super annoying..Facial recognition on this phone is a joke..I don't like Samsung's overlay on Android Nougat.  The Samsung keyboard sucks. Stock Android is so much nicer IMO...Overall, for a flagship phone and even at a deeply discounted price I wasn't too impressed with this one.  I have a feeling I would be much happier with a Pixel or the upcoming Pixel 2........",5

4,No premium care if purchased from Amazon,"November 3, 2017",1,"Overall pretty nice phone. Being water resistant is a major plus, and the fact that the touch screen still mostly works while wet is amazing. It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes...Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did)...Despite my many complaints about Samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock OS works well with some tweaks.",3
5,Works with Sprint,"August 18, 2017",1,"**CAVEAT EMPTOR** My phone and phone box were labelled with the wrong MEID number. When I called Sprint to activate, they told me it wasn't unlocked, so you can imagine my frustration. I finally figured out that if you dial *#06#, it will show you your phone's serial number, MEID #, and IMEI#, which turned out was different than what was on the box or the back of the phone. When I then called Sprint to activate with the actual number and my Sprint SIM card, and everything worked out fine...As to the phone itself, it's great. The screen is nice and large, responsive, good speakers, I like the water resistant design, and the swag is great (comes with the charger w/ USB cable, a transfer USB set to transfer info from your old Samsung phone, and a set of headphones. One of the best things about this phone is that it has NONE of the bloatware that comes with Sprint phones that can't be disabled or turned off...Overally, outside of the hassle, this is a great deal on a great phone..",5

The phone looks great, comes with a lot of great apps and is relatively easy to set up. There are some quirks that will take some time to get used to, but that's probably true for any new phone.

Apparently, this phone has an issue with NOT being able to send sms texts.  Spent 2 hours in the Verizon store trying to get it sorted out.  2 factory resets, and 2 additional SIM cards - still will not send SMS texts...Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is:.-The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment.  Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone..Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera.  Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around...So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner.  If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere...I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time).

1,NEVER BUY THIS PHONE OR DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY!,"November 19, 2017",0,"To be honest, I purchased this phone June 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. The biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. Every time I let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. Not sleep, not screen off, SHUT DOWN. It has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the ""best phone out there""..Next, the always on screen. Sometimes it is literally ALWAYS ON. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. Anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if I a not watching. Also, in this state, if it isn't charging and I put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. The only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. Very frustrating but I dealt with it because it is ""the best phone out there""...Now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. I assume the battery had dies so I plugged it in. Normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. The LED light would also blink at the top....nothing. No LED light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. I then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling Samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. It just will not turn on...So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things I just spent 3 hours trying. Still nothing. I also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that ""During the applicable warranty period, provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty, Samsung will repair or replace the Product, at Samsungâ€™s sole option, without charge."" So i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and I would ship this broken one back, done....nope. The woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though I read her word for word what the warranty stated. The only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. All of which will take 2 weeks! I replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. I asked her nicely again to replace it as I cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. After a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. Very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently  but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on Samsung products...So now I am sending the phone back to Samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. In the interim I plan to buy another phone THAT WILL NOT BE SAMSUNG. I have been a Samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, TVs, all new kitchen appliances. To be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. After tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. This is the reason why Samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. As far I am concerned there will never be another Samsung product in my home and I will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty...Unless this company makes this right I will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another Samsung product, period. The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. Losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. Further I plan to post this review anywhere I can so that as many people considering Samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus...",62

After a beat down by the salesperson for buying an unlocked phone online, she proceeded to warn me that lately, Verizon has been ""refusing to activate unlocked phones"" not purchased through them.  However, after standing my ground, the salesperson backed down, retrieved a SIM card and activated my new S8.  Be persistent!..Awesome phone with wonderful features - and pretty snappy, too!

1,What a piece of junk!!!,"January 21, 2018",1,"I had high hope for Samsung's flagship phone, but was very disappointed...The positives:..1.  The phone has a headphone jack, an SD Card slot, and wireless charging..2.  The phone is unlocked and has the transmitters necessary to work on all four U.S. carriers..3.  The Wireless Hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege..4.  The Screen is sharp and bright, just like prior Galaxy phones...The negatives:..1.  No hard button on the front.  I really appreciated that the earlier Galaxy phones that had a physical button.  I like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you.  It allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place.  That tactile feedback is missing on this phone.  Also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button TWICE, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/PIN.  That means a total of FOUR actions just to get the phone to the home screen.  That's just stupid...2.  No user replaceable battery.  This is simply inexcusable.  I know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary.  There is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user.  It would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover.  Even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery.  I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S3 and S4, both of which had a user replaceable battery...3.  Oddly sized:  This phone is too tall and too narrow.  As a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well...4.  Oddly shaped:  The waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved TV sets.  Initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image.  In the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges.  It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped...5.  Bixby Button:  Bixby is a Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri.  There's a dedicated Bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button.  Samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button.  But, in order to do so, you *must* create a Samsung account, share some personal information with Samsung, and link Bixby to the account.  Until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button.  Again, this is stupid.  If Bixby is so great, people will choose to use it.  Samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so...In the end, even though I got a smoking $574 Black Friday price on this phone from Amazon.com, I'm going to send it back and either keep my S6, or upgrade to S7 instead........",5

But when I got this phone the Bixby feature was a minor problem. After a month its gotten even more annoying the fact Bixby would come up and whats worse, is we can NOT reprogram or disable that button. Later on I realized there was a lot of other crap-ware Samsung was forcing on us that would popup up as well. The worst was when I wanted to take a video and yours truly Bixby vision came up and I missed the shot. There are other problems but all were minor what bothers me is the amount of small problems.

No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen...I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER...",32

2,Not in love with the latest flagship from Samsung,"October 11, 2017",1,"I have owned the galaxy S2,S3, and S6(flat Display). With all of those phones I was happy from purchase, to replacement (usually fleeting battery life). I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed...Cons.1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed).2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried..3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen).4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement..5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future...Pros - (most other flagships are equal here).1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining..2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps..3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices..4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too...In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display.  I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months...Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if,.1. I can get a flat display again.2. Take the buttons off the screen..3. Bring fingerprint scanner back to front..",6

For example having different sounds for different apps,Facebook,messanger,emails and so on does not seem to work or at least I have not made it happen. At the moment I seem to get a ring or ding but then when I go to check my phone I have nothing showing I have missed a message.

4,"Good Phone, But Steep Learning Curve","December 16, 2017",1,"Nice size, getting used to it's function. Just a bit different from my Windows phone, which was very easy to use, just very buggie after the recent OS update. Nice display, quick function, just a bit of a challenge to navigate around the phone. Imbedded apps are a pain, and slow the phone down. Google got it right with their Pixel 2. Aftermarket products are hit-or-miss for the S8, as many cases for this aren't very snug-fitting. READ the reviews for cases and accessories. Some really suck.",0
3,Not As Advertised,"December 18, 2017",1,"This is a great phone. It does most of what it's supposed to and is a huge upgrade from my S6. Took one star away since it advertises use of the fingerprint scanner as a means to take pictures with the front facing camera. It doesn't work. I called Samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. Still didn't work. Face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely...Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare. Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, Bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method). Still happy with my choice, but 3 stars seems appropriate...",0

The placement of the fingerprint scanner is my only gripe (next to the camera lens... really?) but the awesome retina scanner makes up for it.  I've read some say the retina scanner ""takes too long"", but mine unlocks consistently in under a second...This is a deceptively tough phone, but you'll want a case as it's pretty darn sleek...",0
3,May be a Chinese ripoff clone.,"February 7, 2018",1,"For some reason even after I do the initial setup on this phone, webpages will default to Chinese for a moment and websites that use location won't be able to verify my location. All of my settings are set to the US, GPS is always on and I still have these issues. I feel since Amazon lets a lot of knockoffs in their store that this could be one of them. Still preforms decent, aside from that, but very skeptical.",0
1,The camera is great but the phone itself,"August 15, 2017",0,The camera is great but the phone itself....negative.  The glass on this phone is very fragile.  Even in a case this phone is fragile. Most cases cannot protect the infinity screen.  Visit Samungs website and go to the community forum and look for broken screens.  I wish I had before my purchase.  I shattered the back and it is costing me $70 to repair.  And of course if there is physical damage it voids the warranty.  So use super thin glass and then sit back and collect the repair money. I guess they had to make up for the Note 7 somehow.,32
1,Beautiful phone however the glass is junk,"August 7, 2017",0,This phone is great except for the fact that the screen scratches incredibly easily.  Just going in and out of my pocket the phone shows a multitude of scratch marks running up both edges of the face and randomly across the front.  All I can say is that gorilla glass 5 is definitely not where it's at.  If the screen didn't scratch so easily I would definitely recommend this phone but because of it I would definitely wait for something else.,94
5,Life long iPhone user converted to Galaxy user....,"December 2, 2017",1,Why was I so loyal to the iPhone for so long?  The Galaxy makes the iPhone look like a toy that you would give to a small child to keep them busy.  I love this phone...  Every aspect of it blows Apple away...  I even went to the Apple store to check out the iPhone X - side by side the Galaxy still looks 10 times better..  I love it.  Customization...  Removable memory.  The best phone on the planet.,0
3,Wait for the S9 or stick with S7,"October 13, 2017",0,"I have been using Samsung phones for 10 yrs..They have made advancements with the S8+, which I truly enjoy however there are too many draw backs for me...The bixby feature is awesome, it took a while to really get use out of bixby for me. You really have to use it in order for it to learn and be useful. I recommend setting it up and going through the prompts, play with it for an hour or two. Set up short cuts. I found that ""take me home"" phrase I used when asking the previous assistant Galaxy to navigate home, does not work on bixby unless you set up a short cut. I do not however like the button. I find myself accidentally hitting the button all the time which disrupts what I'm doing on my phone because then you must wait for the bixby home page to load before you may close out...Two major complaints:..The battery. I was blown away by the battery life when I first got my S8+! I've read a lot about battery preservation so I do not charge my phone while I'm sleeping because leaving it on the charger when it's fully charged kills the battery longevity. So I charge a couple hours a day while I'm at work and that's it. I stream music in the car so I expected that to drain the battery quickly but it did not! After exactly 6 months of use, my phone now loses about 30/40% just sitting idle while I don't use it in just about 3 hours. When I noticed this draining battery issue I immediately took action. I deleted every app that I don't use on a weekly basis. I set up the power saving mode. I changed screen settings. It has helped a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. I now have to charge my phone constantly..Because of the very iPhone-esk style they took begining with the S7, the phone now has a glass back that is not removable. Making the purchase of a new battery to fix said problem impossible. I've always liked samsungs products..but this was a poor decision for their consumers...The screen. While the screen is beautiful and ""unboxed""...it is 10x more fragile than any other Samsung or Galaxy I have owned. I cracked my screen within two weeks of ourchase. I was and still am, unable to find a tempered glass screen protector with a fully adhesive screen (because of the new design with the edge). I have sworn by tempered glass screen protectors in the past, they have saved me so many times. I was also unable to find one for the S7 as well. I did purchase one that only adhered on the edges, which did exactly what I thought it would.  It slid off the couch onto carpet and the screen popped right off the phone. Which for the record does nothing to absorb shock and prevent damage. I have the OtterBox symmetry case on my phone and it still cracked when dropped. Right on the stupid edge of the screen where it curves. Then a few months later, it slides off a shelf in the restroom and lands on tile flooring. Shatters again. I have shattered 3 out of the 4 corners on my screen all while in a case. I'd hate to see what happens when it's not in a case...Overall I am disappointed with this new screen, while it is beautiful and excellent for my photography hobby...it just isn't durable or practical. While the new technology advancements Android has made are excellent, I absolutely hate the quality of the phone. It's literally an $800 glass box around a computer.",24
1,The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks,"September 28, 2017",0,"Don't get me wrong, the functionality of this phone is incredible. However, the phone might as well come with a broken screen. This is the first phone that I have ever broken. And within 3 months of owning it, I have broken the screen twice. Both times were low impact falls from heights of about 2 feet while sitting. Furthermore, it breaks through a case, which is even more baffling...The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks, you're left with an item that you just paid $400 - $800 feeling like you're trying to wait out a contract until your next upgrade is available. It would be nice to just fix the screen that Samsung should honestly feel ashamed about but that costs $150 - $200 unless you do it yourself. And then you are right back at square one with a new fragile screen not suitable for a device that is considered ""mobile.""..I plan on coughing up the deductible to file an insurance claim on the phone. Mostly because the second break occurred in a way that a shard of glass is now impressing the screen preventing me from escaping a black screen while on a phone call. It otherwise works but I cannot look at texts/internet or even hang-up while taking a call...I would strongly advise against buying this phone. Even though I enjoyed my 3 months of use, I wish I had not bought it. Its pretty disappointing that Samsung is not remedying the fagility of this phone in mass. It's comical that a purchaser needs to constantly worry about a $200 bill while using this phone in a fairly standard way. The iPhone X is also a frightening phone since it looks like the same design. I would be exceedingly hesitant to buy anything that even remotely resembles this design in the future..",37

I hated paying that much for a phone but I keep them a long time . The huge problem I'm having with the S8+is the reception sucks. One to two bars if I'm lucky and it constantly drops calls and fails to send text. I really like this phone so bit the bullet and purchased a cell phone extender antenna for version . Another $130 added and a real pain to install. After all this it's not better if anything it's worse.  IS THIS PHONE WORTH IT ?

Shows it's connected  until you try and load a webpage or use an app the Wi-Fi crashes and has to restart and connect.  Will continue to do so and the page will not load till you turn Wi-Fi off.

1,"I don't want thing that only work with Samsung, I want things that work with Android.","December 6, 2017",1,"I have many Samsung products, and am happy with all of them, but I am not happy that this phone requires not just one, but two proprietary pieces in order to charge it properly, or one just to hook it up to another device. It does not have a Micro USB connection, it has an adapter that you need to use just to hook it up to a Micro USB cord. If you plug the USB end into any normal charger, or even a USB port on a computer, the phone takes FOREVER to charge (25% charge over 8 hours). You need to plug the cord into Samsung's ""adaptive fast charger"" in order for it to charge in a reasonable amount of time. The whole reason I buy Android instead of iPhone is because I don't want to have proprietary software, hardware or peripherals, I want to buy things that work across multiple devices. I have Micro USB cords everywhere, at home, in my car, at work, one stashed in my luggage in case I forget to pack one on vacation... now, they are all useless to charge this phone unless I happen to have not one, but both of the proprietary parts needed to charge the thing. Unless, of course, I pay them just to have extras so that I can conveniently charge my phone anywhere that I am. It really seems like Samsung is trying to separate themselves from all other Android products by having their own charging devices, and they even have their own Apps and a Browser. All of this I can avoid if I choose, except the charger part...I, like others, have most everything set up through Google, but Samsung wants to force you to use their Apps and software, like Bixby, their version of a personal assistant. And there is no way to replace Bixby, you can turn it off, but the home key is forever tied to this app. I don't want thing that only work with Samsung, I want things that work with Android...The phone does not have a way to double tap a notification to open it; you need to unlock the phone, then open your notification. I've researched this online, and others have the same complaint and no way to turn on that functionality....",3

1,WARNING! DEFECTIVE!,"November 20, 2017",1,If there's a negative zero i will choose that for this item.I trusted Amazon LLC to be selling efficient devices and I was wrong.It's hardly 3 months since I purchased this item and its not working.i could hardly hear people I am talking to on the phone so i had to use a speaker to hear them.so you can't afford to have a private conversation.I emailed amazon about the issue and because its way pass the return period they didn't help.Warning to those purchasing this item think a million times don't waste your money.Think where its safer to buy cellphones.I believe in Karma what goes around will come around.,8

There was no film on it, ear buds were missing, SIM card release pin was missing, and phone was completely dead. It seems like a new phone so I'm sticking with it, but it I think someone took it out of the box, and used it for a time. It explains all of those things. Especially the pin, which should be in a box with the documentation. All the reading material as there, the sheet with the pin on it was missing.",0

1,Form Over Function -- took away the most important features,"November 6, 2017",0,"I am a long time Galaxy user.  My whole family and I have had Samsung Galaxies since the S3.  But this S8 annoys me to no end.  They are turning the Galaxy into an iPhone.  If I wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, I would have bought an iPhone.  But I didn't...Battery:  I have had this S8 for 9 weeks now.  I cannot make it through the day without the phone dying.  That's bad enough.  But far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. Lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the Achilles heel of iPhones.  iPhone users constantly complain about it.  So what does Samsung do?  Make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery.  So I guess we're supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. If all the other Galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature?  And don't tell me for waterproofing.  I don't care.  You should be able to figure that out...All-Glass Case:  Are you kidding me?  If you look at the phone wrong, it will break.  And it's unbelievably slippery.  Nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back.  People are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the T-Mobile store and the time Amazon Prime can deliver a protective case. And even with a case, it'll break. I mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass.  Of course it's going to break...Proprietary charging port:  The Galaxy S5 had a USB 3.0.  That was genius, seriously.  The S5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with USB 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it.  In addition, USB 3.0 is super fast for data transfers.  So, what does Samsung do?  Create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn't exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented.  What a great idea -- let's turn the best charging system into the worst.  And that's even worse than Apple.  iPhones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iPhones that use their proprietary cable.  In this case, only the S8 uses this useless connection...Infinity Display:  Samsung touts the ""uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges"".  Okay, one question.  Did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market?  Because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the ""seamless edges."" Obviously.  So, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. So, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone.  I'd like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool?  In case someone from Samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: NO ONE.  No one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone...In other words -- form over function.  Give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway.  Stop copying Apple, and bring back a real Samsung Galaxy...",32

4,Detailed Review from Dedicated iPhone User,"August 5, 2017",0,"Are you on ios and wondering how difficult jumping ship to the android flagship phones would be?  Well, that is exactly what I did and here is my experience...I'm starting with my Conclusion because this is long: I love the hardware aspect of the Galaxy S8+ with very few exceptions. It's a beautiful phone. After a couple of weeks I have my phone useable with fairly similar apps and functions I used on iPhone. I like quite a bit of the additional functionality and customization offered. However, using the phone is like having every developer trying to turn the phone into a personal billboard trying to sell me something unless I'm willing to shell out $2 to $3 per app in most cases. To gain some of the higher end customization without ads can cost $5 or more in many cases.  It is quite a bit less efficient in every day use due to lack of streamlined integration between apps and additional ads...ABOUT ME.I have pretty much used ios for all my smartphone and tablet needs for about 8 years (or whenever iPhone 3gs came out - I'm 99% sure it was before 2010).  I tested an android tablet for about 5 years ago and I was not impressed with the weight of the device nor the android apps so I stayed with ios.  I'm pretty sure after that experience is when I purchased my first iPad.  About a month ago I had a water incident with my iphone 6 plus and had to decide what phone to upgrade to..My motivation is because there are so many exciting phones in the near future, the Samsung reviews are extremely positive, and the Samsung S8+ is so much cheaper than the iphone 7+ after just months of being on the market (and I don't think this trend will change anytime soon). I jumped ship from ios so I could make a better decision about the next iPhone before its release (iPhone 8+ or whatever they name it).  I've used the Samsung Galaxy Plus phone exclusively for about 3 weeks. Here is what I struggled with, my suggestions for non-android users, what I've learned about android ecosystem, the pros and cons post switching, and what I will likely choose next...PHONE DESIGN.Big Pro - This phone design makes people drool. It looks great and it feel great in the hand - especially when you compare the plus size versions.  I could have gone with the plain size of this phone and been absolutely happy. My eyesight isn't that great so the larger screen is great..Pro - The size of the phone is great in the hand.  The smaller one is even better. It feels better than iPhone Plus in the pocket, however the height is about the same so short pockets still cause issues..Pro - Build quality seems top of the line. Buttons work great, etc..Pro - I like the color options better than other phones out there..Meh - Expected to be a fingerprint magnet - and it is. LOL.Con - The hard to reach finger scanner on back - I type the unlock code OFTEN due to placement..Con - Dedicated Bixby button - this button is just in the way; its placement causes accidental Bixby engagement all the time and Samsung has locked users out of reassigning the button..PERFORMANCE/BATTERY.Pro/Meh - In terms of speed the OS (Android Nougat I believe) on this device has come quite a long way. Overall I found the OS response almost on par with ios.  I understand the difference between open architecture and Apple's closed architecture, so this is a great achievement but it doesn't outperform ios in my use so I can't mark it as a clear Pro. It felt capable in every way. It didn't glitch in a way that I didn't find acceptable but ios still wins here..Pro - The ability to change performance modes is nice for increasing battery life or performance. I don't play any high performance games, but the gaming folder options to set the phone as a priority for gaming (no interruptions and high performance) may be the reason for some users to choose this over iPhone..Pro - Quick charging and wireless charging are nice to have available (although I dont have those set up in my house)..Meh - With the customization of this phone, it is easy to affect battery life without realizing it. In real day to day useage, I don't have all my charging stations set up for this phones usb c connector - I have iPhone chargers set up in many rooms of my house out of necessity. With most of the usb chargers I have, I dont feel this phone charges much faster than my iPhone. In my experience so far the phone underestimates how long it will take to get to a full charge by quite a bit maybe 20 or 30 percent. The good part is that I don't think it will be any worse than using my iPhone - but I'm not charging this thing any less either..DURABILITY.Big Pro - Waterproof. Since my last phone died due water and I was always putting my phone in a ziplock bag to run when weather was questionable or out at the lake, this is something I am glad to have..Meh - Screen glass is marketed to be pretty scratchproof. I've ordered a screen protector and I tried to keep the film on the glass while waiting for it to arrive, but the film didnt stay adhered but 4 days or so.  I've been careful and only carry the phone in my pocket by itself and I have a scratch. I've never scratched a phones screen this quickly but there are so many factors that I won't list it as a con..Meh - I cant speak to back durability personally since I was able to find protector quickly and have not dropped the phone. But videos online show that the back can crack if dropped on concrete from only 3 feet which is about waist height. Although other drop tests show it surviving drops from 5 feet, most crack the backglass at this height. Drop tests online seem to indicate decent front durability often surviving a 5 foot drop. From what I've researched, the front seems as durable as (if not a bit more than) an iPhone and the back really dictates a cover..SCREEN.Pro - The screen resolution is great. I do like the screen, but in use at mid arms length away I can't tell much difference with the resolution at max or the mid setting. I appreciate the ability to run mine at the mid setting to save battery life..Big Pro - I stream movies on my phone often and getting a larger video with a more narrow phone is a GREAT experience..Pro - The curved glass is just sexy on electronics. The screens edge does a great job of ignoring touches when holding the phone. That edge is visible when the phone is face down so it can be set for notifications and I've seen the ability to run a stock ticker down it..Pro - Always on display with very little battery impact. I didn't realize how often I turn on my phone just to see the time or even date. Once this is set to disply the things you are 'just checking,' you will save some battery life..Con - The screen seems VERY dim in comparison to iPhone. It is capable of a comfortable brightness, but when maxed out I feel like I'm using a reduced setting from my iPhone..CAMERA.Pro - That damn camera bump is gone!!! This phone will sit flat on the table - nuff said if you are using an iPhone..Pro - The cameras (hardware) on this phone are best in class.  I give this phone the edge because in low light, it captures more light than any Apple phone.  In bright light, it's a draw unless you truly have need of the 2 cameras on the iphone.  In my use, my cropped images come out great so a 2nd lens doesn't add the same value as low light performance.  My video needs are the same - I need more low light performance than ability to use a different lens..MEH - I'm not labeling this a con on purpose.  I know there is a phone out there with 2 backfacing lenses. 2 lenses do not make me want that bump on the back of my phone..STORAGE.Pro - You get a respectable 64 Gig onboard and can add a card (whenever you need it) to increase it at a reasonable price using standard 3rd party memory cards.  None of that bulls**t Apple gouging..PORTS/BLUETOOTH.Pro - Its accessories are all generic. It is so nice to buy an extra cable for $2. I know I can buy 3rd party apple cables but some fit well and some are so tight you may damage the phone. I LOVE not having to deal with that - although switching all my phone docks and cables did cost a few bucks. If the next iPhone switches its port, I wouldn't be able to use them anyway..Pro - The earphone jack. I am no audiophile and have gone wireless for audio in most ways. But by design, my car connects phones to the radio with an audio cable. This phone requires nothing new to use that. Its an added plus when I forget to charge my wireless headphones..Con - The usb c connection just doesn't feel as tight to me.  When I connect the cable it doesnt align straight as easily as the lightning connector - even with using the cables provided with phone. Also, I get errors from different chargers that the phone is not connected completely. I think the error is because the phone is expecting a fast charger, but it has me a little concerned about reliability in the back of my mind..AUTHENTICATION/SECURITY.Pro - Eyescanner is great for unlocking phone. I've had better restults than many reviews. Mine will usually scan me correctly from a reading position if I pull the phone up toward my face about 2 feet. Even in dim light it usually reads which greatly reduces this next con..Con - I am sooo used to the fingerscanner, it is an unatural action to unlock ANYTHING on this phone. The placement is not where I can reach it naturally so I have to shift the phone to scan and it has gotten to be a real pain in the ass when I unlock apps..Con - Eyescanner either does not work to unlock apps (like paypal, etc) or it isn't coded in a way to easily connect it. It seem to only unlock phone..Con - Did I mention logging into apps is a pain in the ass on this phone? Dashlane is an app that makes this a bit more bearable but once you know how easy it is on Apple it is hardly comparable replacment. If you use financial apps, you will dedicate some time to trying to get around this. I think on the standard phone the fingerprint scanner felt more accessible so this may be an issue specific to the plus model..Meh - Facescanner is available but a photo can unlock the phone. As easily hacked as this is, I don't see the point of using this. Maybe if I wanted to lock a younger child out of my phone. Anyone over the age of 8 that wants to get into your phone will get past this lock..Meh - I generally don't feel as secure with my data in the apps, OS, and features of this phone and the android infrastructure. Many find this a pro since you can choose all these different apps to help. It is the same feeling when I use my windows computer, security is all on my shoulders and I better address it someway. And all the free solutions have ads. Apple has a great track record with securing data, privacy, etc. Everything I read about setting up android points you to security features to enable. Am I protected? I've installed some suggested apps, but who the hell knows..CUSTOMIZATION.Pro - Out of the box, this phone is one of the most highly customizable phones available to change your experience to how you want the phone to look and behave. You can add and remove features of the OS (like the app drawer which iphone users do not have), edit how app icon looks, rename or remove app names, etc. Some customizations are pretty sweet - like backgrounds can move with movement of the phone and the camera can be used to sync the background with whatever colors the camera is capturing..Pro - The keyboard can be reduced in size and offset to the side of your prominent hand so that the keys are easy to reach with one hand. If the Big Con for word prediction didnt exist, this might be a reason to change phones when using plus size..Meh - Speech of OS. It is good but Apple does relistic speech better..Con (if new to android) - It is overwhelming to use this phone out of the box without some grounding first. It may be licensing or userbase expectation, but there are dual applications for many functions. It is preinstalled with Samsungs version of chat, email, and browser apps as well as the Android standard equivilent. As you set these up and start using them, they'll be prompting back and forth to change defaults. Some are similarly named and the functions between each have nothing dictating where the app settings will be located, how to engage the settings, etc. The OS does not have any wizard guiding you through steps in an order that makes sense. Apple sort of walks you through step by step of creating your Apple account first, then security choices, etc. You get none of that here. You keep tinkering with creating accounts and settings until something works, then you move onto the next thing you want to work. It may take a week to get this phone to replace an iPhone completely if you use many apps at all..Big Con - Using the keyboard drives me close to insanity because of how often the wrong word appears. It is functional (I've defaulted to using Gboard after some comparing of 3rd party) but it takes about twice the effort as iPhone. If I hadn't used iPhone I likely wouldn't notice but I have used one and I notice this fault - every time I have to type an email or text message..Con - I have some loss in trust in settings to take and work as expected. I've had this phone ring at work when I thought I had do not disturb set. I do not know why the setting changed and it was easy enough to address, but you must click and look for check marks, okays, enable, save buttons that iPhone never requires you to click.  There is no standard across the platform so unless you exit and go back into a setting, I never know it took..Big Con (for my use) - Enabling handicap features can be painful. On iPhone, I can set my phone up to triple tap to enable text to speech so the OS will read aloud to me. I use this very often to have kindle books read to me without having to rely on audible or paying for whispersync books. Enabling this on android is very difficult and it will not continue to read past a paragraph max. If someone has figured this out, please respond with comment..Big Big Big Con - Ads, ads, everywhere. Do you like having your phone boot into a screen with a big ad displayed in the middle of it? Well android provides that functionality - in fact every developer over uses it in a way iPhone users do not experience. Once you customize and get some crazy ad resulting, you'll need an app to find what is causing it. In fact, I almost returned this phone on day 2 because of an ad. And I got some good advice I'm passing along to you if you keep reading..FUNCTIONS.Pro - Best 3d experience available on a phone. For under $10 you can get a 3d headset for your phone and be immersed in some pretty awsome videos. Yes, iPhone does this too, but Samsung does it better. What I did not know is that the experience is 360 degrees. You'll need to stand up to turn around and see what is behind you, but when you are flying in that jet, you can see the pilot if you turn around. I watched a cartoon with aliens in front of me and rabbit hiding behind me and I missed half of the action because I kept trying to check what the rabbit was doing. This is not something I need to have in anyway, but it is fun and costs very little to get set up. Be forewarned, you will be seasick after your first use and riding a rollercoaster standing up in 3d can make you fall down..Pro - Audio over wireless just sounds better to me compared to iPhone 6. I don't know about other versions but with same headsets I get more bass, etc..Meh - Phone calls are okay but I'm not impressed with the app. It is harder to use and integration between apps is not all that great. Here are some of the items harder than iPhone - answering a call, finding and calling a contact, setting up a 3way call, adding a new call into a current call (still haven't gotten it to happen), selecting a phone number in another app and having phone app open and call..Meh - Bixby is Samsungs response to Siri (and Google Assistant which is on this phone also).  In concept Bixby should develop into something more useful than Siri for chaining commands together (set this setting and opne this app, or open this app and do this), but it is not fully realized yet. Having to hold the button for the duration of the command comes difficult to me and it feels unnecessary and I just don't like it. And I don't like that button anyway. Engaging google assistant is the same as Siri and I like that way of turning it on better. I've used Siri more so I know what to expect and I know what it does. I have less favorable results with both of these but Bixby was only recently enabled. I think it may develop into something pretty nice to use if Samsung will rethink that button and the requirement to hold it for the duration of the command. And honestly about half the time I've clicked on the Bixby button, I was trying to hold my phone or adjust my volume - bad placment..Con - One better like clicking okay and yes to use these apps. Android suffers from the same thing Windows does. You have to click an extra time or 2 to get a function to set. Even when logging in right now, I may have to push the home button, then swipe up, enter a code, and then click an ok to proceed. On my iphone, I pushed the home button and let my finger rest there and I was in. The majority of system settings and apps have similar unneccessary extra selections and swipes..Con - Speech to text in voice assistants, text message or email is truly unpredictable. I did not truly appreciate how well Apple does this until I stopped using it on this phone. It is really that bad in most real life situations that I want to use it..Big Con - There is an emergency call button (it will dial 911 if you click it) that is badly placed on the unlock screen. I conciously have to avoid hitting that stupid thing 20 to 40 times a day. It's these things that seriously puts iPhone ahead of Samsung in actual usage.  I don't have issue with it there, but I need option to move it up on screen where I won't accidentally hit it. I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT HATES THIS..Big Con - Audio volume is ok for music apps but it has an annoying warning about excessive volumes damaging hearing that I want to disable forever and it won't let me. I wouldn't mind seeing the warning and have it go away in a couple of seconds, but you must interact with the warning manually. It is especially irritating because of this next big con..Con - Audio in apps are extremely low when using cabled headsets and at least some on wireless. One example is podcast apps. I have to max out the phone volume and increase my car stereo volume to hear them at the same volume of songs. I use a jabra headset when driving in my car - it's what I used to use with my iPhone and the same issue is present with it. I don't know how many apps are affected, and it may be setting related, but it is an issue out of the box..Con - Videos do not go full screen by flipping screen sideways. In almost every instance iPhone does this by default. It is not the case here - ofen it takes a click or 2 to get that to take..APPS.Pro - Multiple app stores to download products..Pro - Because android allows more access to hardware and OS, there are apps for a whole different use than what Apple apps provide. There are many apps to add functionality to the phone. The phone can go into silent mode or reduce its volume anytime you arrive at work for example. You can change your icons from developer default to marbles with the app name listed on them..Meh - Apps are mostly as functional as what IOS equivilent provides, but they aren't streamlined for ease of use. I miss my iPhone apps quite a bit..Con - Most underground app stores likely have viruses in part of their offered apps..Con - Most free apps have ads..Big Con - Unless you are willing to download apps from 'risky' locations, apps without ads are double or triple the price on Apple. I rarely see any paid for app include an ad but I see many paid for apps include apps after purchase..UNTESTED.NA - Provided headphones. They are marketed to be $100 street value but I use wireless audio and haven't had the need to test yet...And here are my suggestions for those not used to Android:..Don't do as I did. As soon as I got basics down (before I sorted out what I needed to work), I hit the store and got lost in downloading free apps. Before I knew it I had a bunch of apps I didn't remember the function for and I included a launcher that sounded soooo great.  And then I figured out what came with those downloads - apps. I was UNHAPPY for a day with an app on my home screen. It was from the launcher by the way. The launcher made me about half crazy trying to work against it. So, if you are stuck in this mode, uninstall, uninstall, uninstall. Airpush Detector is an app that can help identify sources of ads...Stay with Samsung's default touchwiz launcher at first.  A launcher gives you a look and feel to the device and determines what functions you can add and remove from the settings.  When new to android, touchwiz gives plenty to play with and see what is available and you don't get embedded ads up front...Put the settings app somewhere you can find it easily...By default, the touchwiz launcher gives you a main landing screen that has a google search field and the primary row of phone related apps you see on every screen and one seconadary row of icons that belongs to this landing screen only. When you scroll to the right, the primary row will go with the view and the secondary will go offscreen with the rest of that landing screen. The idea is that the apps on the secondary row are your most frequently used apps along with the main phone apps on the primary row. When you scroll to the screen to the right, that screen is similar to what iPhone screens look like - a grid for placing apps over a chosen background. Each time you scroll to the right you can add one of these grid screens as iPhone does. Something not found on iPhone is an app drawer. It is available from each screen, if you swipe upward on the primary row - there is an up arrow on the primary row indicating the app drawer and you can choose to keep or remove a dedicated button that opens it as well. That drawer has a default copy of every app installed on the phone. If you want one on any of the main screens, press and hold an app inside the app drawer and it will let you pull it upward out of the drawer and it will drop to whatever location you release it at. The copy will remain in the drawer unless you explicitely delete or hide it from there...If you already know you don't like the app drawer concept, you can remove it and the upward screen swipe function will go away and all installed apps will drop onto the those grid screens - just like how iPhone behaves. If you are getting lost looking for apps, go ahead and remove the app drawer now to get closer to the iPhone default setup: Settings app icon &gt; Display &gt; Home screen &gt; Home screen layout.  I suggest adding it back at a later date to see if you like it later; once there isn't so much to get used to at once...You likely are used to having a set of apps on the main row of your homescreen from whatever smart phone you come from. Change the row of apps on the primary row to match what you currently use and set those apps up for use...The timeout to black out the screen is way too fast when one is trying to figure out how to configure the phone. Go to settings and change setting not to lock if looking at screen.  Bixby can help find - just hold the button and ask to change that setting. If you have no Samsung account, you get to set up your account now...The phone is likely completely unlocked to anyone - you should set up security at some point - I suggest setting the passcode, the fingerprint scanner &amp; the iris scanner. You'll be unlocking the phone once you do this, so decide if you want to do this now or later...The phone comes with 2 app stores installed, they are Samsung Market and Google Playstore.  I do not group my apps by developer. I group them by what they do. I suggest you pull the apps out of any folders they are in and put the near each other.  I usually look in the Samsung Marker first to see if there is a version of an app developed specifically for this phone and if not, I look in Google Playstore which will be developed for android phones in general...Next get some sort of security on the phone. Most carriers will have some sort of security app pre-installed. Launch it and make sure it is set up. I also installed Avast from one of the app store due to its popularity across android forums...If you are like me, you now have lots of apps running in the background. Press the dedicated recent softkey next to the home button. It is indicated by 2 arrows making a box. You can close them all...Initially, I was getting confused by apps provided to do same thing. Select an app for each function and remove the other app..Messaging clients: I hid Messages (it wont uninstall) &amp; stayed with message+ until I could navigate the OS easily..Browsers: This is a difficult choice. Samsung Internet(purple globe) is designed to be integrated with this phones hardware and shows to be most similar to iPhone's browser for efficiency.  In my usage, it blocked sites that Chrome didn't and that I didn't feel were unsafe.  If you have no preference and gmail isn't your default form of communicating, I'd disable Chrome (no uninstall available) unless you have same issue I had. If you are tied to gmail, I'd use Chrome and hide/uninstall Internet if it'll let you...If you were using an iPhone before, Samsung has provided an app called Smart Switch to hook to your iPhone with provided hardware in the box (the one with the usb hookup adapter) and it will scan your iPhone and set up your contacts, move your photos if you have room, and find matching apps from the stores.  I'd run that at this time...Now go find a free background or theme you like in one of the stores..Select what displays on your always on display..Set up your apps and you should be set to use the phone for a bit...Once you are comfortable using all that you have set up - maybe a day or 2, set up the edge app. You'll have a better idea by that time what might be nice to have on that shortcut...Other Suggestions:.Set do not disturb on a schedule (in the settings app) if you get woken up by text messages and such at night..Block blue light with sunset (in the settings app) - supposedly reduces affects of phone screen on your sleep..Set finger scanner to swipe down to pull notifications open - honestly I dont use it, but go ahead - it's kind of cool...Note:.You cannot delete apps that are sitting on the primary apps bar - you must relocate it to the grid. Depending on app, it may not allow uninstall, but you may be able to disable and/or hide.  Worst case, make a folder and hide all unused apps in it...After a few days, research what a widget is and set one up on one of your screens - Maybe a calendar or a clock..After a few more days, research what ""edge"" apps are available to you...Some apps that I'm using:.Ad source finder- air push detector (suggested by coworker).Downloaded &amp; changed keyboard to GBoard (suggested by forums and tested well against others I tried).Ad blocker - Crystal Ad blocker (can't remember why I chose this).Pw manager - Dashlane shows up top in many reviews (you have to engage the app to set up the pw).Browser - Puffin pro (free has ads) for speed of use - but it has a drawback of memory consumption compared to other browsers.Chat client - Textra (mainly testing from high reviews).Widget - I'm using a widget called Month to put a calendar on one of my grid screens.....",26

The selling point being that it's an ""edge"" is kinda pointless being that most cases cover up around the edges. Gets in the way of some video formats, covering the bar. And the screen protector helps but because of the ""Edge"" it leaves the sides exposed. Now the case will cover it as I said, however it will also slowly peel the Screen protector off. And believe me you are gonna need that case. All the protection you can get. Had a foot drop, not only do I have a cracked screen but an actual hole. Waterproof selling point out the window. With such a high maintenance phone, idk why you would have it near water in the first place. Had this for a few weeks, battery was great until recently,  drains more quickly now. Damn ridiculous. (Update: beside battery continues to diminish it total life span, now having trouble shooting and storing photos. They become corrupted) I'm done with this phone, should of given LG a chance.",7

4,"Great phone, Verizon compatible with a few minor bumps","September 13, 2017",1,"The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+.  It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates.  I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5...In the end it was worth the upgrade.  As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5.  I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning...Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon.  This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store...This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a ""Verizon Branded"" S8.  Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out.  After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything...Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all...Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app.  You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store.  Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me...Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8.........",7

5,Amazing phone,"September 17, 2017",1,"I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .)..This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy:.-Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though).-Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though).-Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself..-Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...).-You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!).-Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.).-It still allows your to insert microphone jacks..-USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.).-And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival...Some downsides on the phone:.-Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone).-Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone..-Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled..-Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though...This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional..All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all...(Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)....",6

Horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. I haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  Note that if you contact Samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. Buyer beware!",13

1,"Good Phone, Atrocious Customer Service","November 29, 2017",0,"If Customer Service is important, STAY AWAY. The phone is great but if it needs service, don't count on Samsung to do what they promise. My phone arrived with a scratch in the Gorilla Glass. I talked to a Samsung rep who said they would for sure repair that and we arranged to have my phone sent in. They ask you to send in the charger and cable too, so I did. After a week, I received a $300 quote for the repair I was told would be no charge. By the end of the call, they agreed to fix the scratched glass. Another week went by and I received my phone completely unrepaired and missing my charger and cable. I called back and the rep I spoke to said the repair was approved but somehow it was never authorized so they just sent my phone back to me. After further discussion, they PROMISED to take care of the screen and asked me to send in my phone. I trusted their promise and sent in my phone. After two weeks, I received my phone back, again unrepaired. Another call to customer service later and they couldn't tell me whether they were simply inept or if they had just lied to me. The experience has left me sour for not only Samsung phones but for all other Samsung products as well. As far as I'm concerned, if it's a Samsung, it's not going into my house.",4
3,"Excellent phone, but no replacable battery","August 4, 2017",1,"Excellent phone.  The only three things keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating are:..1) No replaceable battery.  If the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset.  Also, when the battery will no longer hold a charge you are SOL (And this will happen sooner or later...it will force you to buy a new expensive phone even if a new battery would fix the issue at a much reduced cost)..2) Bixby...just plain annoying!  The button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes Bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations..3) Curved glass.  While this looks sleek and ""sexy"" it is kinda annoying.  If somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone.  Also makes screen protectors a lot more expensive and elaborate...Can't argue much with the price though, much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else.......",10
5,Best phone I've ever owned,"November 11, 2017",0,"I'm going to start out this review by stating that I have basically hated the Galaxy S phones since they've come out.  I loved my old Samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to Android, I just couldn't get into them.  I read how amazing the Super AMOLED screen was, and I thought it was garbage.  It was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off.  The UI was cartoony and had weird colors.  Over the years, though, Samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their Android skin, and after all this time I can finally say that they've sold me...The feel:..The first thing I noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels.  It's crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass.  It has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium.  It feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble.  With the infinity screen it (and its brothers the S8+ and Note 8) is easily the most attractive phone I've ever seen, a departure from the older Galaxy S phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me...While the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand.  While it's still a stretch, it's more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive.  Speaking of the on-screen keys, I've never been a fan until now.  They work well and the home ""button"" even has a vibrating ""click"" when you press it in, which I like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot...The physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which I don't like, and the Bixby button (which I'll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find...As much as I like the design, this phone NEEDS a case.  I don't mean that as a bad thing, although for some people I'm sure it will be.  It's delicate.  The all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you'll find reading reviews and watching drop tests.  The edge display detects accidental touches on occasion.  The volume keys are too clicky.  The phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop.  A case solves all of these problems.  Even if I didn't work in construction (which I do), I would put a case on this phone.  I personally went with the Spigen Rugged ArmorÂ <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Case-SpigenÂ®-Rugged-Armor-Galaxy-S8-Case-Cover-with-Resilient-Shock-Absorption-and-Carbon-Fiber-Design-for-Galaxy-S8-2017-Black-565CS21609/dp/B06XNNJ4KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Galaxy S8 Case, SpigenÂ® [Rugged Armor] Galaxy S8 Case Cover with Resilient Shock Absorption and Carbon Fiber Design for Galaxy S8 (2017) - Black- 565CS21609</a>Â case, which I highly recommend.  There's even a Youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever...Software:..For years Samsung's TouchWiz was bloated and ugly.  I hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the Super AMOLED screen).  But now, with the paring down of bloat, it's finally become useable.  A while back Samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and I'm glad they did.  I was able to change all of the default Samsung apps and menus into the black shades that I love so much.  You can even replace the icons with a different themes, although I ended up using Nova Launcher with some icons I had bought for it...I like the way Samsung has set up their apps.  They are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features.  Probably my least favorite is the Gallery, although my complaints are minor.  My issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file.  The little overlays that tell you if it's a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures.  But the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use.  Everything runs fast and I even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (I had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me...There is still bloat though.  Samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of Google's, which aggravates me.  It would be fine if I planned on sticking to the Samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but I'm not even close to making that commitment.  I still use all of Google's services, because I can use them on any Android phone.  You get Samsung Calendars, Samsung Health, Samsung Pay (which I'll elaborate more on), Samsung backup, and others.  It's mostly not a chore to use Google's features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you're using their Google equivilants...To be honest I didn't even try Bixby.  Google Assistant is more than I need, and I don't like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for Samsung's digital assistant.  Fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that.  The button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable Bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone...The Galaxy S8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the Edge shortcuts.  This is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with.  There are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end I didn't see the need for one more thing on my screen.  That being said, I think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature...Samsung Pay is a feature I was surprised by.  My phone came with a promotional $50 credit via Samsung Pay so I was obligated to use it.  The first time I tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn't do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen.  I calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment.  I got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way.  I've used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with Samsung Pay.  As cool as the first two times were, I didn't appreciate looking like a fool while I waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot...Hardware:..Another feature I was surprised by was the fingerprint reader.  I found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler.  It's very quick and let me log into my Wells Fargo and Paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc.  Yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera.  However, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone.  Once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue...Battery life so far has been great.  This is the seventh Android phone I've owned, and I don't recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life.  My galaxy S5 I briefly owned (used, to replace an LG G3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors.  This one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today's world that's the most I hope for from a cell phone.  I do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime.  The battery is not removable however so keep that in mind...I've never tried wireless charging before, but I did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and I had to buy new cables anyway for the new USB C standard, so I snagged a wireless charger from Amazon.  I didn't use the Samsung charger or cable so I'm sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead.  This works well for me for charging overnight, but you can't use your phone while it's lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses...Call quality has been wonderful.  The volume of the ear speaker is actually more than I need, which is a good thing.  I'd rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder.  The external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way.  I didn't get any complaints on speakerphone mode...The screen almost needs its own catagory.  As I stated, for years I've hated Super AMOLED.  I don't get how people thought the early screens looked good.  The saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed.  But finally, with this phone, I feel that the colors and saturation are perfect.  The screen is super bright too, and in fact Samsung's auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first Android phone I've ever had auto-brightness turned on with.  The resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which I recommend not messing with.  You can turn it up to 4k, but it's not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly.  As it is, pictures and text are extremely clear.  Everything just looks so great on this screen, I find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it.  The infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides.  The phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it's locked.  The brightness is turned down so that you don't get screen burn-in, and I found that I liked this feature, which didn't seem to affect battery drain...The camera is one of the reasons I bought this phone.  I've heard for a few years now that Apple and Samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality.  In practice, I'm mostly happy with my choice.  In well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful.  Colors are great and they've very clear.  Burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second.  Low light shots were a mixed bag, though.  The lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring.  This is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but I honestly expected this phone camera to do better.  Perhaps it's a setting I need to enable, but as of right now I was a little disappointed.  However, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, I suppose I don't have much choice but to accept it...Summary:..I know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person's life and I feel like I needed to share my full experience to buyers...Overall I love this phone.  There are no major issues with it and using it is a joy.  I'm sure it's partly the new phone effect, but I find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so I can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance.  It has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory Samsung bloat, but so far it's been a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend it.",3
5,the phone is brilliant. Sharp display,"September 14, 2017",1,"Ordered this device while Harvey was ongoing. There was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays...The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range...Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs...The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps...The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens...I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!.",5
4,"One of the best available (compared with iphone 6s, LG G6 and Huawei Mate 9)","September 29, 2017",0,"UPDATE 12/22/17: My phone is still going strong and looks pretty much the same as when I first got it. I'm still using the same Speck Candyshell Grip case and same liquid install screen protector. They are in great shape and providing enough protection tor my phone. The glitchy stuff seems to have mostly been fixed after an update. I have the unlocked version. Facebook app has been sucking big time, so I mostly access facebook through a browser and only use the facebook app to post pictures...When picking a phone over the past few months, I tried iphone 6s(hated the locked down feel and it had major battery drain with my music app that could not be fixed, so that was a deal breaker), Huawei Mate 9(Has a good camera, good battery life when battery drain isn't happening, but it isn't optimized for google apps and gets battery drain every couple weeks so I had to reset it all the time, ridiculous), LG G6(Great front camera, loved the wide-angle option, terrible front camera circa 2013 and bad connectivity with my Honda UPlay and Google play music)......And, now the Samsung S8, I have had it for a month now. It takes pretty good pictures. The Mate 9 had more detailed pics, but S8 takes better low-light photos in my experience. I'd say they are about tied for front cameras. The selfie camera is slightly better with the Mate 9 than the S8 because you can adjust more on the Mate 9 and the focus seems to be a little better when people stay in the background of a photo and not side by side. I prefer the Mate 9 photo gallery, too. It's easier to select photos to share. The speakers are a bit quiet and not as nice sounding on the S8 verses the Mate 9. Mate 9 has loud speakers with stereo option when it's side, but the S8 sounds acceptable and is much improved over my old Samsung S3. It's quieter than the LG G6 as well and comparable to the iPhone 6s. I heard the newer iPhones have stereo speakers and get pretty loud, though. But, new model iPhones are too expensive for me and offer less features than android phones at a similar price...So far, the Samsung S8 is still the better phone, it's more reliable, it does not have battery drain and the battery life is consistently allowing 6-7 hrs screen on time if all used in one day or around 5 hrs if used over 2 days. I do have to restart my phone sometimes because of minor glitches here and there. Not often, just a couple times a week, so no biggie. It does have a buggy connection with Google Play Music and Honda Uplay, but it still plays the music, it just causes the menu to flash on and off, but it's ignorable and better than not working like the G6, Mate 9 didn't have this problem, but the battery drain still makes Mate 9 a loser for me. I prefer the smaller feel of the S8. It feels very comfortable to hold as compared to the phablet phones like Mate 9. Samsung S8 has many accessories available to it that Mate 9 did not offer in the US due to lack of popularity. S8 has a car charger option, battery pack charger option, and many cases and screen protector options. I tried a couple cases and found the Speck Candyshell Grip case to be the best, I like that it gives some protection around the edge part of the screen while still leaving you full functionality and it's not bulky. I dropped my phone a couple times in the case from a couple feet up and the phone is unharmed..I used an IQ shield liquid install screen protector and that works well even though it takes longer to install. No issues with it coming loose until now. I don't like the curved phone screen, but the Samsung S8 is one of the best phones available and beats out the competition in my opinion. I got mine for close to $600 with tax, I don't think I would pay more than that. Watch for sales. It's been on sale many times since it's release. I would not recommend buying from Samsung directly. I bought one S8 from Samsung and returned it before going back and buying it again elsewhere. The return through Samsung took a month and I had to contact them a second time before they finally processed the return with some message about getting lost at the facility or something, but they still have a note about receiving it. Amazon is a good place to buy from as long as you buy directly through Amazon and not through a third party. It's nice that they give you a 30 day return period. That's the longest period I have seen anywhere...If you want an Android phone, Samsung is still the best available in the states, in my opinion. There are more nice phones available overseas, but you want to have a US warranty, easily available accessories, etc, that leaves you with Samsung, LG, Google, and iPhone for the most part. One big negative with Samsung is that screen is SUPER expensive to replace. I would not get a Samsung S8 if you are rough on your phones. There is an S8 active available through ATT and it's supposed to release for other carriers and maybe unlocked in the future from what I read. Maybe Amazon will get it, too?.",3

1,Phone screen designed to break sooner or later,"November 7, 2017",0,"This phone is very fragile, I accidentally dropped it 1 ft high and it broke in 3 different places. It is tough to find a good screen protector that protects the phone and not degrade screen sensitivity. The setting to increase touch sensitivity which was available in the S5 is now gone so there is no way around this problem. The thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. Either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later. It is as if Samsung intentionally designed the phone so that the screen will break (so they can sell more $200 'gorilla' glass screen'?) Other gimmicks are the 'Bixby' app which pops up constantly if you swipe the phone unintentionally in the wrong direction, and the edge screen which accidentally activates some menus while holding it. So you will have to try to hold this slippery phone by avoiding the front edges which increases the chance of dropping and breaking it.",7

5,Best phone out this year at any price...,"October 9, 2017",1,"The best phone at any price right now.  I'm looking forward to next year when I may go for the Samsung Note.  I was a ten year iPhone user and finally lost patience with Tim Cook and his mediocre product development.  He's no Steve Jobs, not by a long shot...  This is the best phone and still has a proper headphone jack.  Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds, I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack.  With Apple and now Google Pixel phones committing to what is obviously a very controversial move, it seems like there may be a bigger agenda.  Maybe one of you software engineers can figure out what is the huge advantage of taking away a feature of the phone without adding to it.  Seems like maybe there is some larger reason, like maybe the bluetooth  headsets allow the companies to track you differently.  Maybe the headsets communicate with every wifi device in the world and tell them what you are doing.  I just don't get why they go out of their way to remove it, when it obviously still fits.  Samsung did it, but these other companies can't?  Got to be more to it.",3

I have been a lifelong Samsung Galaxy customer and was very excited when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge about a year and a half ago. This phone is a hunk of junk and Samsung is wrong to continue selling it. Do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there  are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, SD card corruption--the list goes on. My problems began about three months in to having the phone. So much money was spent on it that I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I'd previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. I took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. This took care of the notorious ""pink line"" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. The line returned in all it's obnoxious and infuriating glory. Again, I could go on endlessly with other complaints--but trust me you and anyone who glances at your phone won't be able to ignore the screen problem...I will not be buying a Samsung product again..",4

With the last Apple device being the iPhone 4, I gave it a go with Android. Initially hesitant to use Android starting with the HTC Evo, but eventually after testing out Samsung Galaxy line, I decided it's worth a shot. One thing I love about the S8 is the Infinity Display.

5,Love the new design,"September 15, 2017",1,"Amazon was having a $200 off deal on this when I purchased, which... is really good for a new phone, actually. I moved to this from the S5, and it's a big change. Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly...My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case...My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now...",2

2,"If you enjoy owning a good phone case protector and screen protection, then stay away from these curved-screen phones.","January 30, 2018",0,"I bought my Galaxy S8 directly through the Verizon store, but I need to vent here on Amazon to warn others about he Galaxy S8 and even the new Galaxy S9's that are coming out very soon... Overall, the Galaxy S8 is a great flagship phone, it's fast, and offers amazing features. The biggest downfall, and why I'm likely to return it and grab a Pixel 2 phone, is a severe lack of good-quality aftermarket phone accessories that properly protect the phone. I'm used to going out and buying an Otterbox Defender, or a LifeProof for FULL phone and screen protection, and being happy about it. Unfortunately, if you look up the reviews for the Lifeproof or the Otterbox for the Galaxy S8, you will see just how much of a difficult time the aftermarket accessories providers have had with trying to FULL protect this Galaxy S8 phone because of its curved screen...Because of the curved screen on this phone, it is VERY hard to find ANYONE who makes a fantastic all-around screen protector or case for the Galaxy S8. Sure many people SELL cases and screen protectors for this S8 phone, but if you actually read most of the reviews on the aftermarket protective devices for the Galaxy S8, you'll see that the curved screen causes all kinds of issues such as killing the functionality of using the heart-rate sensor, or fingerprint reader, or the touch screen not working properly or as well as it should because of a curved screen protector goes on top of it. The curved screen on these Samsung phones, in my own humble opinion, is a terrible fad that needs to go away. It reminds me of when Samsung and others were also trying to push their hardest to sell curved LCD/LED TV's after the 3D-TV push to the American market failed due to impatient TV manufacturers waiting for 3D and curved screens to take-hold...When I bought my Galaxy S7 I purposely opted for the NON-curved screen because I was on the fence back then too. Now that Samsung has completely forced everyone into an ""all-or-none"" scenario where I can only buy a regular-sized curved screen, or a bigger-sized curved screen. After having tried this Galaxy S8 for a week now, buying the Otterbox and Spigen screen protector along with some tempered glass protectors that kept popping off because they only stay secured to the curved screen via a thin glue that is applied ONLY around the edges of the glass screen protector, and then trying the Lifeproof Fre case, and then trying the Ghostek waterproof case...I've just about lost my mind. The curved screen on this phone has NO good product that I can find where there is not a gap between the screen protector and the phones actual screen, making lots of texting and typing a major pain. The cases all seem to hinder functionality of fingerprint and heart-beat sensors and mess with the front AND back camera lighting a little, and they muffle speaker phone calls a bit... I could live with all the downsides EXCEPT for the touchscreen issues. If you cant touch the phone properly and make accurate presses, then the phone is useless and fails in its biggest goal as being a smart phone. Add insult to injury, every case I've tried still still leaves the curved area of the LCD screen unprotected (otherwise you wouldnt be able to use tabs or the curved screen functions)...but because these cases never properly protect the edge of the curved screen, it means that there is always a possibly of dropping your Galaxy S8 and it lands at such an angle where the edge of the curved screen hits first, and this will easily cause a broken or cracked screen. Look at the reviews for various Galaxy S8 cases and screen protectors on Amazon photos, and you'll see many broken-hearted people who thought their phone would be safe from a 4-foot drop onto the floor...These curved screens need to go away. Until I can get a FLAT-SCREENED phone with no dumb curves from Samsung (flat screens make it easier to get third-party accessory support for protective cases that actually work properly) then I'm done with Samsung after this recent headache. It's too bad too, because I've been a loyal Galaxy user since the Galaxy S2, and I've owned the S3, S4, S5, S6, AND S7 and was always very happy with the case and screen protector options that I could buy in the past. With this Galaxy S8, I'm almost certain it will end up broken with the S8 cases and screen protectors that are currently available on the market. Therefore, the Galaxy S8 goes back to the store and I'll have to buy a different Android phone. Samsung, please cater to all of your customers while keeping phone protection in mind. I'm sure that Samsung loves broken phones while selling replacements with all of the accidental warranty services out these days...but I dont want to buy a $700 to $1000 phone only to have crappy physical protection for it due to a silly curved screen. A curved screen isn't worth the potential losses and breakages to me...Seriously, what the heck...",2
5,"Wow, it's great","November 27, 2017",1,"This is quite a phone..It's extremely fast compared to our older Samsung S4..It's unlocked, so even when the kind folks at Verizon looked at me as if I was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the Verizon network, I knew it would (having read the reviews at Amazon) and I just told them to produce the free small sims card.  (Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.).If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone.  The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already..One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone.  You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps.  Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference..I can't get over how fast this phone surfs the internet (I use Firefox) and how nicely photos are auto-arranged by date..",2

I am a HUGE Samsung fan and this is by far my favorite and has not disappointed me yet. This phone is amazing. It definitely beats out its Apple competitors and if you do not believe me then do your research because this phone is unprecedented. I LOVE it and it is worth every last penny! It will last for years to come and it is built to resist shatters and drops and it is even water resistant for up to 30 minutes under 5 feet of water!!! It is smooth to the touch and is extremely fast!! The memory usage is fantastic and the features it comes with are great. I recommend this to anyone buying a new phone...it is everything seen in the commercials and more. It has Bixby on it and she can do ANYTHING... I often use her feature to remind me where I parked or turn the lights off!!! Amazing technology and great phone!!!,2
5,"Unlocked S8 (SM-G950U1, US Version) from a big box retailer","October 11, 2017",0,"So many other reviewers have posted exemplary write-ups detailing the features, benefits, photos of the S8.  I won't even try to compare. All I can tell you is that I needed to replace my 3-year-old Galaxy Alpha, so when the Galaxy S8 went on sale over Labor Day weekend, I walked into a big box retailer (whose name rhymes with ""guest guy"") intending to buy one of the lesser priced prior year models like the G7. However when I walked into the display area, the S8 winked at me, it was love at first sight, I was stunned and floored by the beauty, grace, forward-looking design, advanced features including VR, and vibration control video camera performance that reminded me (in my simplistic estimation) of Hollywood steadicam, a far cry from my prior Alpha's performance in that regard.  (Plus, simply, when it comes to Android, where obsolescence unfortunately happens rather quickly, newer is better, because it gives you longer usable life.)  I bought.  I haven't looked back.  The two of us have been joined at the hip (literally) for almost 2 months, as I mated it with a very inexpensive, minimal size holster case that visually recedes out of the way to allow the stunning beauty of this phone to shine (while continuing to buffer it from shocks)...Phone setup was a breeze, as I merely unplugged the micro SIM from my Galaxy Alpha, plugged it into the S8, and my cellular carrier was auto-configured by the S8, so you really can't hope for anything cleaner than that. Plus the simplified migration utility that came with the S8  copied over my files and photos, my contacts lists and more, from my prior phone...I spent a fair amount of time optimizing app power use.  The S8 now uses minimal power while I'm out and about, and at night it takes no more than a few minutes to bring to full charge again, ready for next day...A chief buying criteria for me was camera performance. I found amazing praise in the comparative reviews published at GSMArena, a prominent factor in my willingness to purchase the S8.  Camera performance matches or exceeds reviewers' expectations...Unlock methods:  fingerprint / face scan / iris scan / voice scan / nearby device detection / draw pattern / type a PIN.  (I've used face, fingerprint, pattern.)  Fingerprint wasn't working for a while but Samsung fixed with a firmware push (Nov 2018)...I'm a guy who has consciously avoided the phablet phenomenon as I can't imagine carrying a massive hunk of hardware wherever I go. The S8 has surprised me with its incredibly large viewable area, while still maintaining a manageably slim and narrow carrying profile, the perfect fusion of function, beauty and utility, in my opinion...Read some of the other reviews, see it for yourself, and allow yourself to believe that there truly can be such an exceptional piece of engineering...So far, it's been a joy ride...",1

The phone is light, sleek, feels good in hand, feels good in pocket, is more sturdy than I had thought, is fast, great photos, great interface and has an expandable SD slot (which my nexus didn't have, so, improvement)...The biggest caveat I've had so far is the Bixby button.

The local repair shop wanted $400 just to repair it!  Sorry Samsung. Build a beautiful full featured phone that can take at least a little drop!  I would not recommend this unless you are willing to shell out extra for a good extended warranty.  From what I've learned, its not ""IF"" the screen will crack its a matter of ""WHEN"".",3
2,Most Fragile Phone On the Market,"September 3, 2017",0,"This is a great phone in terms of its power and UI... Pretty much any phone in this price point is going to be amazing, and it definitely fits the bill in terms of specs and performance...However, it is probably the most fragile phone ever made.  I have never broken a phone in my life, and I drop my phone as much as the next person.  You can tell the second you hold this phone that it is amazingly fragile.  The whole thing is made of Gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily.  Crazy that this design was actually approved, I don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic.  Any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market...The design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket.  I can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (I am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it IE breaks), but I had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when I sat it immediately started to slip out.  I think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones.  I have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment I put this phone in my pocket...My phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact.  The fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least.  Shame on me for not having the case on it (I literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case I purchased was at home)...  However, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... Again a drop no more than 2.5 feet...Insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or I guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long.  My S5 fell 2 stories and didn't get a scratch. This phone fell 2 feet and spider cracked to a point where I need to get it repaired.  One of the most important aspects of a cell phone is its durability and ability to handle everyday life and people where accidents happen at one point or another is guaranteed.  The fact you have to treat this phone with the delicacy of an infant makes it almost a burden to own...Between the failings of the S7 and the beyond poor durability of the S8, this lifelong Android user may switch to Iphone my next phone purchase a few years down the line..",3

The Pixel 2 doesn't have a headphone jack so I opted for the s8. This is a great phone! I'm sure there are more detailed reviews out there, but overall, I love this phone. Smooth interface, beautiful form factor, headphone jack, no problems using all my apps. I like the unusual screen shape, which is a bit longer than typical, which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super-wide phone. It does overheat more easily than my earlier Nexus 5 (to be fair, I accidentally took it into a sauna so this is an unusual use case) and there are times when the touch screen isn't quite as responsive as I'd like, but it's a solid phone for the price. I've used multiple apps and functions, hooked it up to Bluetooth speakers and headphones (regular and Bluetooth), connected to multiple WiFi ports, etc. And it's handled all of that pretty comfortably...It's slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case. I bought a super thin Humixx case (red!) that I like, and no problems..",1

However, within a few days it stopped working, displaying no network available error code on screen. Problem is, we were at home and my phone, an older Samsung S4 Active, also with ATT was working so there definitely was ATT network service available. Turned the phone on and off a few times, still no signal. Finally, using my phone, called ATT customer service. Forty five mins later with numerous instructions from ATT Agt, using my phone, finally managed to get her phone up and running with Agt stating he had found an error on the part of the store sales clerks initial registration process. Ok, fine. Fast forward 3-4 days later, same problem + phone was shutting itself off for no reason. Back to customer service using her phone this time. It would not allow her to make any outside phone calls or text messages, giving same no network available error code, yet it would allow her to dial customer service using 611, however. Another long conversation with ATT phone rep again who, this time suggested taking phone back to store and have the sim card replaced. Phone was now 16 days old since purchase. Did exactly that and store clerk changed out sim card. Still didn't work. Tried 2nd sim card on same visit and it didn't work either.  Store clerk then erased electronic serial number in their system, re-typed same ser # back in, reinserted 2nd sim card, rebooted phone and it finally worked but only for about 4 days before same problem occurred again. Problem is, she had to go out of town to a funeral and needed a dependable phone. She was so frustrated by now, she had ATT store switch sim card back over to her old iphone 5, which at least had always been dependable, if not very exciting. Thus she was safe on the trip, at least as far as having a phone she could count on again. When she returned home from funeral a few days later, she immediately called ATT customer service, once again explaining her problem. Another 30 min conversation and they now wanted to send her a refurbished phone replacement for a phone she was paying a new phone charge for, not a refurb price. She refused the refurb and the ATT rep finally told her he was making note in file, recommending the selling ATT store take it back. She also called Samsung directly and their rep told her to take it back to store and have them do a factory reset before sending it in to Samsung for warranty repair. Samsung rep was sure that would more than likely fix the problem. So she took the S8+ phone back to ATT store where she bought it, demanding a new phone, since they couldn't seem to fix it. They refused and in stead, sent her sixty miles down the road to an Atlanta Corporate ATT store, the Mgr of the selling store stating he was sure the Corporate store would replace it, what with the ATT phone rep recommending same. Corporate store mgr. was indignant, rude and emphatically refused, stating the selling store should replace it. By now, after several ATT dog and pony shows, failure on their part to do the right thing, my wife had had enough, drove sixty miles back to selling store, dumped the non working S8+ phone as well as the Samsung 8in Tablet they had also talked her into buying with the S8+, demanded a refund for all and a receipt for the returned equipment. ATT store clerk didn't have the authority to do an immediate credit, stating she would have to get the owner to do it over the next few days. Seven days go by with no credit on her acct so she now drives back to store, talks with the clerk again, who immediately credits her acct and credit card for all eqpt. Store clerk admits that this was 3rd Samsung S8+ returned within the last week for similar problems. Meanwhile, a few days later a Samsung factory rep comes by this ATT authorized store, poo poo's the apparent S8+'s problems, stating that it was just probably a bad batch of S8 phones, with no other explanation. Well, now my wife feels pretty much snake bit by Samsung and ATT over this uncalled for ordeal and is in all probability going to change to Verizon or some other carrier and I am sure, by now you have surmised she will not be purchasing a Samsung anything. She's too scared of them and what appears to be a lack of current quality control on Samsung's part compared to their good reputation in the past. Having been an ATT customer for more than ten yrs, she was very surprised and disappointed to learn of ATT's apathy and argumentative nature when failing to back up their phone with proper service after the sale. Additionally, I have been an ATT cell phone customer on my line since 1989(formerly BellSouth) and we are long time Direct TV customers. After seeing how she was treated I am also considering looking elsewhere for a different carrier and equipment, after continuously being their customer for over 28 yrs. Any company and any carrier can have problems. It's how they handle those problems that either insures brand loyalty or causes you to look elsewhere. All they had to do was to do the right thing to start with and give her a new phone that worked. Having refused to do that, what can we possibly expect from them in the future. We are currently paying almost $300.00 a month to ATT for our phone and Direct TV service. Even that did not motivate them to replace the phone, a phone which at the time was less than a month old. We sincerely hope your experience with both ATT and the Samsung S8+ phone is a better one than hers was. My phone is overdue for an upgrade but living thru her experience causes me great pause in considering any new Samsung product, inspite of fact that I have had my S4 Active for several yrs with no problems. I have never looked at another cell phone network provider in all my yrs of ATT service but I now feel compelled to at least see what they can provide.",10

I am just going to say the 6 was way better!! The talk-to-text feature is horrible, the preemptive text is a joke - on the rare occasion it actually gets the words right AND spelled correctly, it capitalizes all the words it is trying to correct or thinking you may want to say next - even if it is the middle of a sentence!! Then there is Bixby, which, well, just no. It is all bad. Then there is the cutting edge camera in this phone which is really just ok unless you want to zoom in and, no matter, the lightin, you may as well forget it. I definitely miss all the things about my Galaxy S6. Buying this S8+ was a huge mistake. The only good feature on this phone is the size of the screen. I love the Galaxy phones, but this particular model is just a huge fail! I would definitely recommend skipping this model for an earlier one or hopefully the next one that cpmes out will but a lot better. Veey unhappy with this phone.",1
5,This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek,"December 6, 2017",0,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!..Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Homeâ€™ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible...This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the â€˜Homeâ€™ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!..The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR...When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then Iâ€™ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds itâ€™s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in â€˜Cameraâ€™). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) â€˜Foodiesâ€™, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!..Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my â€˜Talk and Surfâ€™ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so itâ€™s a toss up!..As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and havenâ€™t gone back!  â€¨..",1

5,Wow,"November 2, 2017",0,"I can not say enough about this phone. It is as perfect as a company has done creating the perfect smartphone for me...This phone is PERFECT in my hand. Its screen is big but you wouldn't be able to tell because it is in such a small footprint. The phone is light. The worst thing about the design is how slippery it is. But a skin or case will fix that.The bezelless display makes it look leagues above every phone out there other then the Pixel 2, Essential Phone, iPhone X and LG V30. To me however the iPhone X and the S8 are tied aesthetically. They both represent the next generations of what is a smartphone. I almost bought a LG G6 before I even held this phone and thank god I didn't buy it. It doesn't compare aesthetically at all. I can list many reasons why this phone is better then all phones other then the Note 8. The V30 is debatable. And the iPhone X isn't available to the masses yet...The screen is AMAZING. Which everyone knows Sammy Mobile creates the best screens around. However, I came from a Note 5 to this thing and could instantly see the difference. Which is crazy because I didn't think the screen could get any better at a QHD resolution (this screen is only QHD+ because of the 16:9 aspect ratio)...At first I thought I would hate the aspect ratio. I love squarish phones so much and prefer my displays to be more square then rectangle. But I actually got used to it fast. Content on this looks so good with that aspect ratio. Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Video and the native Samsung video app all support a zoom in function. At first I was thinking this would be terrible because it would look stretched and things would be missing I needed to see. But no. They did an AMAZING job with the zoom feature. It's the reason I was finally sold on this aspect ratio. With out it I would have never gotten this phone...The cameras are amazing. The pixel is the only one that compares. Even the iPhone X looks night and day compared to this phone. It may be preference but shots from this phone are so much better imo...I waited a month before I wrote this review to see if the phone would start slowing down or stuttering. Nope! I run a launcher and a custom notification shader and my phone doesn't even seemed bothered. My Note 5 slowed down and sputtered when I customized the heck out of it. My S8+? No problem...The fingerprint scanner, iris scanner and facial recognition are all amazing. I have used them all and had no problems. Yes photos can trick facial recognition. However I am way more worried about a stranger robbing me or stealing it then I am of someone I know taking it. So facial recognition to me, has gotten a bad rep on this phone. As well as the fingerprint scanner. I pull out my phone conveniently with my finger in the same spot as the fingerprint scanner. So to me this design works. When I am using it two handed I just slide my left hand up and it really isn't that bad. But it is the biggest complaint on this phone. That says A LOT!..Battery life has been phenomenal. I crank it to max brightness. Wifi is usually on, NFC and bluetooth. I am still averaging like 4-5 1/2 screen on time...With a bezelless gorgeous 2K HDR screen, 4 gb Ram, Samsung Pay, the cameras, the security features (Samsung Knox, Pass, Secure Folder and the various biometric locks ), the light skin over Android, the specs that future proof it (LTE-A/LTE+, Bluetooth 5.0), big battery with great longevity (battery cycle count a lot higher then all phones before it) and wireless charging, HEADPHONE Jack, exedra exedra this is as perfect as a cell phone as you can get imo. Front facing stereo speakers are the only missing feature I can think of. But even then the speaker on this is really nice...As you can tell I love this phone. Probably my favorite peice of tech since I got my iPad Pro 9.7. Definitely by this. If you don't get a V30, Note 8 or iPhone X instead if that's your thing...Easiest 5/5 rating I have ever given...",0

5,Top of the line phone for those attendees of Church Android - don't read if you attend Church iPhone.,"December 7, 2017",0,"I bought this S8 phone directly from Samsung as they were having a big sale just before Thanksgiving, plus they were giving $400 rebates on my old phone (a Samsung S7 I purchased from Verizon).  My old S7 was in great condition, but ... it was locked into Verizon, and despite what their offices will tell you, it's difficult to buy a SIM chip overseas to purchase service in order to avoid Verizon's high cost international plans.  When the phone arrived, I put in a new 64mb memory chip, enabled Wifi, logged into my Gmail account, and almost immediately Google started sending my apps to the new phone.  I spent an hour or two recreating my pages, and then the dreaded moment arrived - time to move the Verizon SIM from the old to the new, and either go online or call Verizon to associate the new S8 with my old SIM/phone number.  But ... amazingly, within 30 seconds of installing the SIM, the S8 became fully operational and was using my phone number!  Easy, peasy.  No logging into Verizon, wading thru their Customer Svc dept - nada.  It just worked!  So, how do I like the new S8?  Well, I could do without the curved glass, and don't like doing without the home button and the quick unlocking of the phone, but ... the battery life seems to be longer, although it's still a bit early.  Am finding that if I'm going to be away from electrical power it's best to disable the biggest battery hog of all time - Facebook.  It doesn't hurt to disable it, as it comes roaring back when you open it, but while in disabled mode it's not constantly polling the Mother Ship and drawing the battery down.  Oh, and the camera seems to be a wash versus the S7.  At some point, and maybe we've reached it - smartphones will have a level of perfection which - for all practical purposes - can't be exceeded.  Sorta like PC's.  About the only thing Samsung and Apple can do, IMHO, is to compete on the basis of price.  Tis inevitable.  Look at what's happened to the cost of laptops and desktops.",1
4,Not as fragile as you might thing being all glass,"September 4, 2017",0,"I like the phone in general its an amazingly dense piece of technology.  One feature in particular I was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone.  Ride with GPS app can keep accurate topography on my rides.  I have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying.  I removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when I took the phone from my pocket or just whenever I picked it up to do something else.  The bicycle mount that I use with it also would press that button.  The moto X touch free voice assistant is superior to the button...I'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me.  its cool but I  think I'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider...The VR viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what I was used to with MotoX phones.  Although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and I have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix.  I'm having a little buyers remorse right now.  Turns out that since I am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on Ebay.  Packing it up to send away for that tomorrow.  5 - 7 business day estimated turn around.  The S8 Active is interesting but more than 2X the price.  Given my usage profile, bulkier and more durable would be an acceptable trade off...Update on the repair:  it went smooth, I was billed as expected and got the phone back in a few days.  THEN I drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact.  Just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass...Full disclosure, I did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where I was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier..  Given that it is front and back glass, its not as fragile as you might think.  Still, its glass, so dropping it on a rock doesn't end well and the direct bonded OLED + touch + 3D glass assembly is not cheap to replace when it happens.",0

I am really disappointed with the Galaxy Software and store. I love Google photos but the camera app keeps forcing the Samsung app on me. I gave it a two star for the software and lack of ability to uninstall most of it. You can disable some apps but they are usually back at reboot. Even with all of my Google app store credits from survey rewards, this will probably push me over the edge to go to iPhone.

4,Losing the physical home key and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back near the camera lens was a little annoying at first,"August 13, 2017",0,"Definitely a noticeable improvement in speed from the S7; it seems snappier. Losing the physical home key and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back near the camera lens was a little annoying at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly. Even though the physical home key is gone, there is still a satisfying tactile ""click"" for feedback if you press down on the location of the home key. You also can lightly touch the home key and it will respond, like the back and menu keys...The size is nice. The screen is narrow enough that I can reach across the entire screen with my smaller hands, and it is tall/long enough to allow more of a webpage to be read on the screen at one time...Bixby seems like another S voice knockoff that doesn't quite do things as well as Google Voice. There are some youtube videos showing cool tricks you can do with Bixby that can't be done with the other voice apps, but they seem like tricks rather than useful tools. I ended up disabling Bixby, and there are some low-cost apps available to help you do that. The placement of the Bixby button so close to the volume buttons actually ends up with a lot of accidental Bixby pop-ups when you are trying to adjust the volume...The camera is awesome. It starts up quickly and the autofocus is fast. There is plenty of on-board memory for photos and video. One somewhat hidden feature in the Edge is the Animation portion of the Smart Select. You can select an area of the screen while a video is playing and create a GIF. Perfect for making a reaction GIF..",0
3,"Mix of good and bad.  You will need to buy an accidental damage warranty, because this phone is super fragile.","September 6, 2017",0,"For context, in the past three years, I have used a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an LG G5 for my personal line, and an iphone 5s for my work line.  I have been using the S8 for a little while now and it's a mix of upgrades and downgrades from my previous phones.  Before I go into my review, I would like to point out that this review is for the second S8 phone that I got.  The first one (which I ordered from samsung.com) arrived defective, where a dime-sized portion of the touch screen was completely unresponsive out of the box.  While I'm sure every phone manufacturer will ship some defective devices, this has definitely lowered my confidence in Samsung's quality control.  Also, the Samsung customer support is the worst I've ever dealt with, and I spent 9 phone calls and over 13 hours trying to get the issue resolved.  If you do buy the device, buy from a third party (amazon, best buy, verizon, - just not samsung's online store) Here is my review of my second (non-defective) s8 device:..1. The screen - First the good: It gets relatively bright outdoors, and is a high quality screen.  Now the bad:  The curve of the screen is the worst feature of the phone.  Sure, it makes the phone look fancy, but it actually makes the phone functionally worse.  When watching full screen videos, you will always have a  distracting glare on the curved edges of the screen.  This effectively means that every movie you watch in landscape mode will have the top and bottom of the movie distorted and annoying to watch.  Second, I have occasionally accidentally activated the back button with my hand when reaching over to the far edge of the screen, and this is definitely because the curve of the screen allows this.  The curve also makes it more difficult to get a glass screen protector that will make full contact with the screen.  And when you do find one, you'll still end up with a non-contact spot if you dont install it precisely in the right spot.  (I wasted a screen protector trying to find the right position.)..2 - Performance - The performance of the phone is pretty great.  I haven't had any hiccups and everything seems to be running smoothly...3 - Battery Life - So far the battery is better than any of the phones I have previously had.  It gets me through the day with roughly 45% left at the end of the day.  That's from 7:30am to around 11pm.  I'd estimate I probably use around 4 to 5 hours of screen-on time during a full day.  I really dont like that the battery is not user-replaceable, but that's the world we live in now.  Based on how batteries degrade over time,  I suspect that a year from now, the battery life will not be as good as it is now, and I will have no way to replace it on my own...4 - Cameras - The front and back cameras work well.  I do miss the dual back camera that my LG G5 had, because once in a while a wide angle shot would have been useful.  If you have never used a dual back camera before, you obviously wont miss it.  But if you have, you might be in the same boat wishing that samsung had included it...5 - Fingerprint scanner - The offset location of the fingerprint scanner is odd.  If you use the phone without a case on it, this will probably annoy you as locating it by feel is not super easy.  I always have a case on it though, and this solves the problem.  With the case on it, my finger is immediately  able to find the edge of the cutout in the case, landing it directly on the scanner.  As long as your finger lands on it, the fingerprint scanner is actually quite responsive...6. Bixby - I have only used the voice assistant bixby a few times, so these are only my initial impressions.  I have used Bixby pretty successfully using voice commands to have it read and send text messages without me having to look at or touch the phone.  This is better than my experience with google now.  The bixby button is annoyingly easy to accidentally press though.  It hasn't been a consistent issue for me yet, but if my fingers dont learn to avoid it, I may start looking to see if there are any workarounds to remap or disable the button...7 - Build and design quality - This is where all of the professional review sites have gotten it wrong.  Most of the review sites praise this phone for ""feeling premium"" and having a great design. I'm sorry to say but they clearly have no understanding of what premium build quality is.  If they mean it feels like solid glass, yeah it does, because it is.  Both the front and back are glass.  Sure my fingers feel the glass too, but solid and smooth doesn't mean premium.  What my brain knows when it's holding glass is that it's holding something fragile.  I'm an engineer, and this is how I would design a phone if I wanted it to shatter in a drop.  The curved screen makes it worse, as it's significantly more likely that an impact will occur against the glass.  Also, because of the curve, there are no phone cases that will wrap around the sides of the phone.  This means even with a case there is a good chance you will damage your phone if you drop it.  If you buy this phone, you should probably also get a accidental damage warranty, and expect to pay something like a $100 deductible on top of that if/when you drop the phone.  I hope this design fad goes away, because I would much prefer a phone with a flat screen and an aluminum or plastic back...8 - Water Resistance - The phone is supposed to be water resistant, but honestly I didn't have the guts to check, so I'll have to take their word for it...Overall - This is a mix of good and bad features.  The problem is, there aren't that many device options for a Verizon user who prefers android.  I would have gone with the LG G6, but after the build quality and GPS issues that I (and many other people, apparently) experienced with the G5, I dont really want to buy another LG phone.  The Moto Z2 series looks good, and I'd love to have a phone I don't have to be concerned about dropping, but the phone is bigger than I'd like.  The S8 is a nice size.  Given the other options out there, I don't regret my s8 purchase, but I don't love the phone, and I'm not confident that I wouldn't have been happier with the Moto Z2 or G6..",2

5,Huge display and fun times,"November 2, 2017",0,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is one of the largest phones in the market yet it is hard to believe how slim it is. The Infinity Display makes for a huge beautiful screen, which is great for multi-tasking, watching videos and editing pictures, without the distraction of buttons. The size can be a drawback as it is hard to use only one hand unless you activate the one-handed mode. The increased battery size gets me through the day, better than previous models. Having used the fingerprint authentication on my phone for several years, I was a bit disappointed in the placement of the S8â€™s scanner. It is hard to reach, requires me to pick up my phone and I keep smudging my camera. However, I switched over to the iris scanner and it is amazingly fast. I wear glasses and it has worked with them in various lighting conditions with only an occasional adjustment. Some additional features are included with the camera, such as masks and stickers, similar to other social photo apps, and one unique feature is using Bixby search. Though it is not 100% accurate, it does a decent job of finding similar objects just by the picture. It is actually kind of humorous to see what other things it comes up with, like my buddies dog was identified as a Labrador retriever, horse and cattle. He does seem as big as a horse or cow though. Bixby is an interesting feature that is Samsungâ€™s attempt at competing with Appleâ€™s Siri and improving on their own S-Voice. With the dedicated button you can avoid the usual opening commands of â€œHey â€_â€ù or â€œOK â€_â€ù and go straight into what you need. You can still use the voice command of â€œHi Bixbyâ€ù to get things done if you choose to, but I prefer to just hold the button and start dictating. Bixby does all of the usual commands to help you easily send messages, place calls, set timers and reminders. You can also get Samsung Reward points by using Bixby and gaining experience points. This includes just playing around with Bixby and asking some ridiculous questions like â€œrap for me.â€ù In return your earned points can get you gift cards or chances to win prizes. Bixby will also read off the time, weather and news highlights aloud for your alarms, a nice touch when waking up in the morning.",0
5,Best phone out there compared to others.,"September 5, 2017",0,"I had iphone 6+ and changed to the S8. I did not like the over size and weight iphone 6+ and I did not like the small screen size of the iphone 6. The S8 is much smaller and lighter and has a bigger screen which is amazing. The display is way better than iphone 6+ and also is OLED which iphone doesnâ€™t have and maybe the next gen iphone will have on its most expensive model. Pictures and movies look far superior than on the iphone. I needed and unlocked phone so when I travel to other countries I just drop in a sim card from that country and not have to pay roaming charges etc..The S8 supports wireless charging in which I bought an after market wireless charger stand for $16 and works excellent and also can charge while on its side which is nice when watching movies. The screen looks like miniature movie theatre when watching full length movies and most movies fill the entire screen..The memory can expand to 2 TB when available but I just stuck in 128 gig sd card for now. I have lots of FLAC lossless music and it takes up lots of space and also have lots of HD movies. By the way Apple does not support FLAC lossless music which is the most prolific lossless music format available. And also the S8 video is 4k so that takes a lot of memory. You need to up the resolution in settings as the default is not the highest..The benchmarks show that the S8 is twice as fast as the iphone 6+. The battery life seems good but did not have it long enough. Some people say that the battery life is average but with the much higher speed and higher resolution graphics, the tradeoff of slightly less battery life is fine with me. Also the weight factor and size is important to me..It has a built in pulse sensor and O2 sensor which works good and can calculate stress level also..When plugged into my Dell I7 notebook it sees the internal memory and the SD card so easy to load files from the computer. However when plugged into my Acer Aspire I5 desk computer it sees the S8 but not the internal or external memory. Also when using my wifi file transfer app it only can access the internal memory and does not see the external memory..The fingerprint sensor works excellent and after a few times I had no problem putting my finger on the sensor and not accidently on the camera lens. I donâ€™t know why people complain as it is a no brainer after a few times only. I find the fingerprint sensor to be very fast and 100% accurate. However I use the retina sensor to unlock the phone and works excellent also and very fast and 100% accurate so I donâ€™t use the fingerprint sensor unless I have to..I do not know how the new iphone 8 will compare of course but with the new iphone OS 11 you wonâ€™t be able to run any 32 bit programs so many programs will not work after the upgrade. The S8 also retains the headphone jack which is important to me and apple got rid of it of course forcing you to use and adapter. The S8 uses the  C type usb connector which is much better and more robust than the micro usb that most phones come with and now appears to be the industry standard for portable devices..The phone is also waterproof to a certain extent but I did not test it and not sure how water will not get into the headphone jack. The earphones that come with the phone are throw away type but maybe ok for phone call and with good earphone and or headphone the sound is excellent with FLAC lossless music..I like the fact that I can open multiple windows and switch back and forth quickly which Apple OS canâ€™t do and also there is always a back button which somehow Apple feels is not necessary so going back to a previous page etc. is impossible unless the app itself contains a back button. It is also easier to add items in groups than the Apple OS. Lots of other features makes this phone easier to use and manage than the Apple OS..As soon as you get this phone you need to buy a case and a good screen protector obviously due to the front and back being glass. The case would make the size a little bigger but not as big and cumbersome as the 6+..I have not used the Bixby and the left Bixby button should be user programmable so the user has control as to what you want it to do. There are other options to use other than Bixby of course..To conclude, there is no perfect phone but this has the fewest problems of the phones Iâ€™ve encountered up until now and I bought this on sale making the price much cheaper than the comparable iphone also....",0
5,I can confidently say this phone is pretty damn good,"November 4, 2017",0,"I found the opportunity to test the Galaxy S8+ fully expecting to have mediocre reactions to it. After a few weeks, I can confidently say this phone is pretty damn good...The biggest issue I had with samsung phones is the cumbersome overlay and bloatware that seemed to bring the phone to a grinding halt. My previous experience with the Note 4 wasn't lost on me. It worked well at first but lag made it a chore to use. It's only been a few weeks but I've noticed no lag. Apps open zippily; the camera is quick to use. No longer does it seem like there are a million useless apps to clog things up. The new Touchwiz interface seems much more sleek and the Samsung software actually useful. Whichever apps you don't like, you can simply disable. In fact, I find notifications that the phone has disabled unused apps running in the background very reassuring...The display is beautiful. Stunning image quality. I love watching videos on it. Yes, samsung tends to oversaturate images but you can choose to turn this down. Blue light display helps at night to reduce strain on my eyes. Edge-to-edge infinity screen with minimal bezels makes this a beauty to look at, and I receive many compliments on it...Picture quality is great on the camera. Low-light is OK, but day-and-night over my previous iPhone 6. I miss the dual-lens available on the Note 8, but for a single lens, this is great...Battery life is excellent. I use it pretty heavily for music, chat and web browsing through the day and I never run low. If I need a charge, fast-charge gives me a lot of juice with just 10-15 minutes plugged in...Cons:.Bixby isn't great. It doesn't seem to wake up half the time with voice commands. While it's not necessarily bad, it offers no real advantages in my daily use to Google Assistant, which conveniently is also available on this device...Fingerprint scanner. Takes getting used to but with a case, is much more easy to find. Not a deal-breaker by any means...Speaker is terrible. There's a single speaker at the bottom of the phone which is easy to accidentally cover up. I use headphones most of the time, however, and as this is now one of the few phones that still has a headphone jack, is no problem...This is by far the best phone I've had, and I'm glad I went with this over the iPhone X which is going for nearly double the price.",0

It is very nice but a nightmare in trying to keep the glass protected and using a phone case . Because its round age the glass protectors keep popping off. This is a lot to pay for a phone and have a good case to protect it!!,4
5,Awesome phone,"October 27, 2017",1,This is one of the coolest cells ever. I had no problem activating.  I read many reviews before buying it and was all prepared to go through the drama everyone said with activating.  First I connected to my WiFi and transferred everything. Which was simple. The phone walked me through connecting the sub and my old droid. The transfer took 1hr 17m. Then I removed my sim card insert it. The phone detected it was a Verizon SIM and completed update. I was able to make a call immediately. The phone walks you through every feature and it is so simple. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This phone is worth it.,2
3,Great phone but you'd better get a case for it!,"July 25, 2017",0,"Great phone for the most part. Broke the glass on the back the first day by inadvertently leaning on it while it was in my pocket. Also chipped the back when it dropped 2 feet onto concrete. GET A CASE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! Also, I wish the fingerprint scanner was on the front instead of the back of the phone so you could unlock it without picking it up.",5
1,No sale.So much data mining that it effects battery life.,"October 16, 2017",0,"I was skeptical at first when switching from Apple IPhone 7 to the Galaxy 8 after using Apple products for a long time.  Well after using it for a few weeks its going back for an IPhone 8.  Most of the basic features were ok and worked fairly well but had tons of app crashing than with Apple.  The main thing I hated here was you could never fully disable Google data raping.  My phones battery was literally draining due to all the back ground app data sharing with google and if you disable it it's still turned on it 50 other places it 50 different ways.  The display, ease of use, quality and value for money pales next to the IPhone.  if Android was not made by Google it might be a better mobile OS.  The software spends so much time data mining it lags the rest of the experience.  The phone is also cheaply built for such a priming price not to mention its lacklustre battery life even with battery saver compared to iPhone 8 or X.",7
5,"Uses a nano sim, not a micro sim","August 29, 2017",1,"Works great. Only problem I ran into was not knowing that this phone uses a nano sim instead of a micro sim, so I had to convert my sim card to the smaller size. I cut it down with scissors and it did the job. If you don't feel confident in your cutting abilities, you can go to a cell phone shop and ask them to cut it down for you. Phone is fast and was easy to set up. Works well with T-mobile.",3
3,"Good quality and camera, but laggy software and bad fingerprint placement","September 12, 2017",1,"I had this phone for about 2 weeks, but I ended up returning it. The camera was really great and took quality photos. I also like the overall design and feel the phone felt very premium. But ultimately I didn't enjoy the Samsung skin over Android, and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the OnePlus 3. Additionally the placement of the fingerprint sensor was very annoying to me as a left handed person who holds their phone and their left hand of majority of the time. It was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use.",3
4,"Cool Phone, OK battery","August 14, 2017",1,"Phone is cool, can definitly do a lot with it. For once I actually found some of the pre-installed apps to be usefull. Disapointed in the battery life, not nearly as good as all the hype.",5
5,Definitely get this phone,"December 4, 2017",0,"I purchased my Galaxy S8 from the Samsung site only because they gave me $200 for my old phone (Galaxy S5). I was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. I have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions...1. Red screen: This was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. The phone does have a setting that is called ""blue light filter"", which I find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. With this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. Otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. So I had absolutely no issues here. The screen resolution and size are exceptional...2. Fingerprint scanner: It's on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. At first, I'll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since I had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. However, the minute I got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. At this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers I have registered and is many times better and faster than the one I had in my prior phone. I am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever I hold a different phone. So again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. I actually like the location of the scanner now...3. Size: I had a Galaxy S5, which had a 5.1"" screen. This one has a 5.8"" screen and feels much better. The S8 feels long at first but the dimensions ""make sense"" and you quickly get used to it. There's even an advantage here: I normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the S8 a bit longer I can grab it more easily than I did the S5. I have found the S8 much more comfortable than the S8+ both to carry and to hold, and I haven't missed the extra half inch that the S8+ has...4. Hardware and performance: This is a top-of-the-line phone and I have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything I can think of. Videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than I am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. The phone also comes standard with AKG headphones and they are by far the best I've had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, I feel like they will last for a long time. I also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever I was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn't get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. I bought the phone in Coral Blue and the phone color is very attractive...5. Some things I do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that's why I gave the phone 5 stars):.5A) Sometimes I don't get notification sounds if, for example, I receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). I just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. I have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. I'm sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now I cannot trust notification sounds 100%. Note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time..5B) Like I said before, the headphones are absolutely great. However, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. This is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue..5C) Bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with Google Assistant, which I have found even better than Siri at times. I would just prefer that the physical Bixby button could be configured to use with Google Assistant. It's also a minor issue, since I can always press and hold the home button and get Google Assistant just as easily..5D) There are some web pages where, if you're watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. This can be solved by hitting the back button but it's inconvenient. Note: I found that this is true also for the iPhone 8 that my buddy has. Also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine..5E) I was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the Samsung store for this phone. Then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. I have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don't quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. I would recommend that you save your money and don't buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won't work. I would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but I can't have one, unless it's the plastic one Samsung sells...6. In summary: The phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it's great. It's also an impressive piece of hardware, so when I'm alone I also enjoy it quite a bit. I have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when I'm in a call since I have had this phone; I can also say that I can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. The camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. Also, I came from a Galaxy S5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the S8 was very quick and easy, and I was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now.........",0
5,It's really mine!,"October 28, 2017",1,"Oh yeah! Few things I have emotional response to when pleased, but this phone, I love him! The wrap around edge beautiful. Hi def screen. Options in depth..I'm getting to like Bixby too. It's helping open controller I can't find, look up things on the web, dial, message, calculate, set timer, define. Still exploring that feature..Fingerprint unlocks quickly. The complaints about location next to camera, I guess I got used to it faster than the average monkey! Since I use the phone in a holder in the car, I added a 3rd print, for when I reach over the phone in the holder, right index finger upside down..Iris recognition, cumbersome.  But when fingers are wet or in gloves, print reader fails. So iris scanner helps..Using for music and internet radio at the gym with belt holder and Bluetooth earphones. Nice custom sound setting for the headset, rich!.Way way better than my S5..Like the feature that if stolen and they reset the phone, it will not work without my unlock info! So don't even Try to steal it!.",0
4,Not Perfect!  but... A Solid Buy!,"December 20, 2017",0,"I have had this phone for about 5 months now. Now I have owned the S4, Note 4 and now the S8. Samsung is notorious for lag after some months of use. As a previous Samsung phone owner I took some steps to try and mitigate any lag as best I could. I install AVG Cleaner and consistently let it run to clean my device of any unnecessary junk. I reboot it at least once a week! I clear it's ram and delete any background memory hogs that might slow it down. Despite this it has managed to lock up on me at least twice in the 5 months that I can remember and self reboot. There is still some latency but overall it has been pretty responsive. Given the option to purchase it again now that I have had it for 5 months I can't say I would have made another choice. After 5 months it's still a solid phone and in my opinion one of the best phones available as of writing this review.  When I was looking for a new phone to buy 5 months ago I was seriously considering leaving the Samsung line, I was fed up with their notorious lag and wanted something more stable. On the day I decided to buy the phone Samsung had the best deal out. I am glad I waited a while and didn't buy it as soon as it hit the shelves. The price dropped and it came with two free gifts!..Verdict... Great phone! Not perfect!  but... Just Great!",1
5,This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek,"December 6, 2017",0,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!..Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Homeâ€™ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible...This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the â€˜Homeâ€™ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!..The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR...When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then Iâ€™ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds itâ€™s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in â€˜Cameraâ€™). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) â€˜Foodiesâ€™, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!..Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my â€˜Talk and Surfâ€™ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so itâ€™s a toss up!..As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and havenâ€™t gone back!  â€¨.",0
2,Front glass designed horribly!,"December 7, 2017",0,Phone works great but extremely disappointed in the design.  In this case front glass replacement.  Doesn't matter if you have insurance or not it's gonna cost you 150 to 300 dollars.  I consider this a design flaw but Samsung is pleading otherwise...I dropped my phone only six to eight inches off the ground and cracked the front screen.  I've had other phones like the note 3 and 5 and were dropped from higher places and screen fine.  I'm just fortunate enough to have my touch screen still working for now...I'd rate this phone better if it was designed to easily replace the screen..,2

4,Samsung beats Apple on design?,"August 19, 2017",0,"Long time iPhone user that was moved to try the Galaxy S8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. Unfortunately, I had to return the S8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 T-Mobile LTE connection. T-Mobile blamed Samsung, Samsung blamed T-Mobile, so I just returned the thing. I went back to my iPhone 7+ ready to put the whole S8+ experience down as a failed experiment. I originally ordered the S8+ from Samsung's website. The user experience of the purchase and return, compared to Apple, was crude and confusing. I had to call Samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with Samsung was awful. Everything I was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do...But here's the thing, as I went back to using my iPhone 7+, iOS just felt so... boring. And the iPhone 7+ design, which I had previously liked, looked so... dated...Now let's face it, Android is a mess.

And boy do I miss that S8 screen and overall phone design...Then there is this year's Apple contenders.

I don't like the iPhone X's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features arenâ€™t things I would ever use. I didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the Note 8 over the S8+.

It has a great screen, good speakers for calls and playing music, and the touch interface is very responsive.  I even like the curved, edge-to-edge display. However, Samsung seems to be emerging as the king of bloat and has loaded the phone with Samsung's redundant software that adds zero value other than to make Suman feel they are Apple.  Bixby is just terrible.  In fact, it was still in beta when the phone was released.  It offers nothing over Google Assistant or Cortana and yet Samsung added a dedicated button for it and one keeps getting promoted to set it up which I will not do again.  Samsung Pay is completely unnecessary.  The list goes on but Samsung had a great phone going until the software team got involved and junked it up.",2

The naked phone is a bit slippery so I highly recommend the otter box defender case...I bought this phone on sale during Prime Day which gave a nice $200 discount plus they threw in a few free toys. The package included the wireless charging pad which I use everyday but would never pay extra for. It's really not necessary. And it came with the VR goggles which I still haven't taken out of the box. I know the goggles need the naked phone and I keep my phone in the otter box case so I'll never use the goggles.

3,Didn't like it.,"December 30, 2017",1,"So I've owned a Pixil for a couple of years and then put it the washing machine.  Oops. I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with ""Hi, Bixby"". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is ""Ok, Google"". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil.",0
3,"Too narrow, hard to hold, read and use.","November 3, 2017",0,"I bought at AT&amp;T; store at a much higher price; that's a whole 'nuther story!  Pros:  Good camera, fast processor, sufficient memory, sharp display, that's it.  Cons.  It should be said I prematurely retired my perfectly good Samsung Mega (pre-Notes).  So this screen is way to small, small buttons, small type, small icons, small.  The wrap-around edge thing is bogus, just makes it hard to hold without a fat case.  Speaking, tiny thin flimsy and fragile.  The aftermarket is rich with contact screen stick-on guards and robust cases just so you can hold it without accidentally calling Russia, by accident.  Don't buy this stuff in AT&amp;T; store either. It'll cost 5x!  Strange charging cord, all my old ones are obsolete.  New Note isn't any better in size either; I liked my old phablet and they just can't be had any more.  You can still get the I-6S+ which comes close.  Really miss my old phone.",0
1,Independent tests confirm poor durability here,"December 7, 2017",0,"Far too fragile for everyday use. I dropped this from 2-3 feet up (hand at my side), with a case, and the curved glass corner cracked. Samsung of course makes a fortune selling replacement screens, though I'm going to buy another brand phone instead. Durability should be much, much higher at this price point for a device that's taken with you wherever you go. Independent tests confirm poor durability here.",3
1,Unstable system and poor costumer service!,"September 27, 2017",0,"After I got this phone, I used it less than 10 mins later the screen was froze and didn't response to any actions. I couldn't turn it off. The device keeps on for 4hrs (only thing good is the battery last long time?!) and was super hot the whole time. It finally shouted off after the battery runs out. This is my first purchase Samsung product and VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I don't understand why a new device stop working in the very first day!.I contacted to Samsung costumer service and it is horrible horrible horrible. I emailed them several times and NEVER got responds (Their website said they will reply within 24 hrs, never happened!!).",6

Nothing else needed, no activation needed...This is an early review.. Ill append as I fiddle around with the phone...Con:  NO IR blaster (so no controlling infrared devices like a TV or Cable box unless theyre ""smart"" devices on the same network) so you cant use it as a universal remote control like I did with the S5 and S6...",1

I'm completely satisfied with my purchase.,3

Definitely love the storage on this phone. Screen is very pleasing to the eyes. Only critque is the finger scanner. Too small and awkwardly placed in my opinion.,2
2,A great phone ruined by Bixby,"October 17, 2017",0,"A great phone ruined by a dedicated Bixby button that can't be disabled. Bixby is Samsung's attempt to force their Siri-like solution on the world. I hit this button several times a day and everyone around me is forced to listen to this stupid BRRIING sound while I try to kill the app. Other reviewers talk about how easy it is to disable it. You cannot disable it...Again a great phone, but for me no amount of other features can make up for forcing me to deal with Bixby every day...",2
5,Pretty good looking and impressive phone,"September 18, 2017",0,"Pretty good looking and impressive phone. I definitely like it much better than the iPhone 6 that I had. I've had it for 2 1/2 months and so far so good. But Samsung is notorious for their phones doing good for the first 6 months and then crapping out because of their software updates. We'll see. I did go for the Sprint 12 month Forever Galaxy Plan so I don't have to wait every two years to upgrade...The interface is much more intuitive than the iPhone 6. Gorgeous 5.8"" edge to edge Infinity screen. I like how you can crop the screen on YouTube videos. They do need to patch the software to allow users to keep that feature on at all times. Annoying not having that option. Great speakerphone. Loud and clear!..Overall, probably the best smartphone on the market right now. As of this post, Apple just announced their new iPhone X. I remember when Samsung was playing catch-up with Apple, now it's the opposite. The iPhone X seems like a copy of the GS8. Front and back glass. 5.8"" curved screen. Probably the same 18.5 by 9.0 ratio screen as well. I don't think most people care for those fat and wide phones, I know I don't. The GS8 is narrow and comfortable in your hand, still sporting a huge screen size for a smartphone...I was watching Fox News when the iPhone X was announced and these people, who by the way all seem to be on the Apple bandwagon, were cheerfully saying and bragging about the X's face recognition, like this was some new technology. The GS8 already has that going back to the Note 7, as well as having iris scanning which the X doesn't have...Did anyone see that jerk CEO Tim Cook brag about the X's feature of their interactive emoticons, using a pile of crap with a funny face? What class! Apple can keep their NSA iPhone X! I know I know, we have the same problem with Google Android phones as well. Oh well, what can we do? I need my smartphone for work. :-(..",0
2,What they don't tell you......,"August 15, 2017",0,"Will not support wifi calling (or other Advanced Calling features) on Verizon.  I was able to install the Verizon sim and get the phone working without problems but features are missing, with WiFi calling being a big one. Verizon says they are aware of this with Samsung S8 unlocked phones and there is nothing they can do as all features are enabled on their end.  Samsung has not responded to my queries so they don't get any points for customer service...Other things to be aware of: It really is slippery so you need a case, but be aware that the case really won't protect the phone screen because it will be designed not to cover the infinity edges.  It really is too big for your pockets.  Cut a piece of foam board the size of the device and carry it around with you for a few days...Other than the missing features, this phone seems to work fine.  I would not buy it again but if you must, get one from your communications carrier, not an unlocked version..",3
4,"Beautiful Device, Great System, but disappointing durability","December 5, 2017",1,"Relative to what I would have paid if I'd gone full price, I'm happy with the phone overall...I did a side by side comparison of the used device and the brand new device I ordered on my own and with enmployees at the ATT store and none of us could find any imperfections so A+ in that regard...However, after less than two months the speaker is terrible. It sounds like I'm playing whatever I'm listening to (mostly music and podcasts) from the inside of a box. I thought the muffled noise issue might have something to do with water exposure after being near the shower (I know, I know, water resistant does not mean waterproof), so I took some precautionary measures as soon as I noticed the distortion, turned it off, and tossed it in a bag with silica gel overnight. For a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output...Additionally, the phone is a lot less durable than one would expect. I still expected the glass screen to be more resistant to scratches.",2
5,There are lots of negative reviews about this phone but honestly I absolutely LOVE this phone,"October 30, 2017",1,"Okay. There are lots of negative reviews about this phone but honestly I absolutely LOVE this phone. I used to have an s5 until it got old. I switched to LG for 6 months and I missed my galaxy phone. So I decided to splurge and get myself an s8! That being said... this phone NEEDS A GOOD CASE. I work around concrete floors so I made certain to buy a solid, shock resistant case with protection around the edges. I also got a glass screen protector just out of paranoia. The phone works incredibly well and performs my level of work I need it to do with no problems. :)",1
5,S8+ is a Plus,"November 6, 2017",0,"Samsung has created a wonderful upgrade to the S7. First of all, the 8+ has an increased screen size with superior clarity. The resolution is by far the best that I've seen on a smartphone. Also, the camera is very easy to maneuver with great quality pictures. There are many options to use to get creative. Next, the internal storage is quite adequate and double the S7's. My favorite feature is the battery life. Prior phones seemed to need charging constantly. The 8+ holds a charge very well and requires minimal charging. Since I am often ""on the go"", this feature is invaluable! Finally, the processor is far superior. I immediately noticed a difference when using the S8+. However, I would be remiss not to mention a couple of points that have been difficult to become accustomed to with this phone. The S8+ does not have a physical Home button - which I miss because I am a creature of habit. Also, I am constantly hitting the Bixby button when I am attempting to reach the volume buttons. The positioning of the buttons has been a bit challenging. With all of the positive upgrades, I would definitely recommend this smartphone.",0
4,I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+,"September 12, 2017",0,"Operating System:  If youâ€™re a Samsung user, or even if youâ€™ve never owned a Samsung in the past, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+.  This phone is by far the fastest operating phone that Samsung has ever made. This is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up.  This phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it...User Interface:  This phone also has very friendly user interface.  You can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with...Battery Life:  The battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other Samsungâ€™s in the past.  Even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life.  There are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better.  One thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the â€œalways on displayâ€ù, this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life...Water Resistant:  This is a great feature to have on a phone.  You never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places.  You will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone...Fast Charging:  You will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible.  Everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use.  With this charger your phone will be charged in no time...Bixby:  The Bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and itâ€™s supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone.  This is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free.  The one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off....",1
3,Awful for mobile photographers,"September 30, 2017",0,"Awful for photographers. Notice I said photographers and not photography because I'm not referring to the phone camera itself, I'm referring to the phone display. I shoot pictures on both digital and film to share on social media. The camera on the phone is great, not on par with some other flagship offerings, but the ability to shoot raw dng and edit in phone is much appreciated. However, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, I must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. And I knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as MKBHD warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. Here's where the issue lies for me. I shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. When I upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. I checked the images on an a few iPhones and LG phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. This poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on Galaxy phones think I suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. When taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why I picked this phone, the colors I see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! So my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering I wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? I will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue. I just wish the display wasn't so pumped up like it is. Also I adjusted the display colors to cool it down as much as possible and the skin tones are still awful...The phone itself is top of the line, blazing fast, durable, water proof, detailed display. Nothing more you can ask for in a phone besides more muted reds in the display..",2
3,Merely Ok,"December 7, 2017",0,"Pros:.* Battery life is great.  I got a full day off of one charge with regular use..* Screen is bright and vibrant.* Camera is great..Cons:.* Curved edges to the phone make it slippery and slightly distort the image.  They make the phone pretty to look at it when it's off but that's no that point..* Fingerprint sensor on the back is hard to reach. Plus, it's right next to the camera lens so you smudge up the lens trying to read your finger..* Comes bundled with Samung's Bixby AI assistant that you can't uninstall.  It's triggered off of a button on the side that is only used for Bixby...Moved to this from a Note 4 and I miss my old Note.  It was easier to hold and non-rounded edges gave it more usable screen space..",0

2,Mostly Crap...,"February 26, 2018",0,Wanted to love this as I am sick to death of Crapple and their need for two years to copy Samsungs upgrades.  The phone itself is powerful and teh tech specs are tops.  I hate the typing as its no where near Apple.  Koreans never bother to learn English anyway so its not hard to understand.  Its beneath them to do such.  The phone calls coming in on top of the current call take away as the beep just continues over and over.  The music player is lacking as well.  Text are also a pain as app compete with other apps for default status.  Such a pain.  I will probably try LG next.

You pick this phone, and you can use whichever carrier has the best service in your area. You won't be under contract, you won't have any obligations, and you get the best price.

4,An Android User's Review of the iPhone 6: Read this if you are thinking of switching from Android!!!,"January 28, 2015",0,"So I made the switch from using Android to the iPhone back in October, and I've been using the iPhone 6 for the past few months now and can give a detailed review on what it's like to switch over.  Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4.  Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on.  Here are my thoughts:..Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):.1. Camera.  The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone.  Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone.  This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone.  (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user.  Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review)...2.  Reliability.  There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices.  On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else.  Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use...3. Fingerprint sensor.  Once you've used it, you won't go back.  The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor.  The one in the iPhone 6 works really well.  I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps...4. Control of apps.  This is an interesting point.  In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS.  But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera.  In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access...5.  Double tap to bring down the row of apps.  I can't believe no one has thought of this before.  A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that.  You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use...Here are the things that I miss on Android:.1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps.  I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that.  I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there)...2. Better email.  In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone.  You can't do that on Apple.  You can't even attach a single file.  You have to share a file as an email.  So, forget about replying an email with an attachment.  This is pretty annoying...3. Productivity is better on Android.  If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app).  You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected.  It's so seamless.  Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines).  So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app.  It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data...4. Notifications are way better.  Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications?  You have to individually close each app's own notification.  I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched...5.  Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri.  Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one.  More customization and etc...Conclusion:.Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one.  The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg.  I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for.  So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios:..If you are user type.....Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone.  The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices.  I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X.  Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow.  One Plus One is actually pretty cool.  They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse...Medical and Science community: iPhone.  Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS...Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun:  iPhone.  The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone...For older folks: This is a split.  If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn.  Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective.  It is more intuitive than it used to be...Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera.  Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use.  I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves...So was this the right switch for me?  As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android.  While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone.  Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it...Another side note:  Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS).  And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well.  I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it.  So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box.  The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone...Summary and TL; DR:.So there you have it.  An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6.  Do I have regrets switching over?  After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it.  But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points.  If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching...Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android.  However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity.  If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone.  There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS.  It really does come down to personal preference...***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above.  It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails.  You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins.  Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great!  You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox!  And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file.  Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps).  This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise).  ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5.  There are still kinks when switching over if you are used to productive flexibility on Android phones, but right now the 3rd party apps are getting better and better at work-arounds...***UPDATE 1/2/2017:  The iPhone 6 has served me well over the past two years, but I've made the upgrade to the iPhone 7 a few months ago.

1,The cable was not original The screen was not the original The battery was not the original Some pieces like a litter metal plat,"October 4, 2016",1,"I pay for a NEW iphone 6, and the cellphone it is not only refurnished, but badly refurnished:.The cable was not original.The screen was not the original.The battery was not the original.Some pieces like a litter metal plate and some screws were missed.The Apple guarantee is expired because the phone was activated ONE YEAR AGO, thatâ€™s why they send you a paper warning you not to go to Apple store because the â€œguaranteeâ€ù is with them..Obviously, the screen is damaged and I cannot return the device because I am not in USA. Who protects the foreign costumer?..",41
1,It's still NOT unlocked,"July 4, 2017",1,I bought one of this UNLOCKED Iphone but it does not allow me to put my spanish SIM CARD. It's BLOCKED! Please let me know what can I do!!!..I tried with another sim card from a different country and it didn't recoginze it either!!..What's happening?.,13
1,Received Fake iPhone.,"November 29, 2016",1,"Be warned! The product that I received was fake. The product was marked ""new"" but everything was dirty.  Product boxing does not match Apple fonts/colors. Everything feels cheap. The phone's body feels like plastic.  Easily scratched it with my thumb nail. Earphone plastic case has scuff marks all over.  It's a fake product. Searching for the serial number using checkcoverage.apple it comes up as an iPhone 5.",16
1,An Unbelievable Scam,"February 2, 2018",1,"After only seven months of buying this phone it completely goes out on me.  Totally dead.  I had to take it today to some far away Apple Store to have it properly diagnosed and fixed, praying it was just a battery issue.  It was a hardware issue.  This ""new iPhone""  of seven months, according to the Apple employee, is actually three years old, and had been previously purchased by someone else through a Verizon store.  And it had been opened and repaired too.  I can't believe Amazon sells such a scam to its customers.  I want to be fully reimbursed for this product.  Buyers, beware.",3
5,Great company!!,"May 24, 2017",1,"I was very concerned about buying an unlocked phone because of the horror stories I have heard, but my cell service provider was out of stock on the phone I wanted (this one) and the price was very high.  This phone was brand new, my service carrier had no problem setting it up.  I have had no troubles with the phone at all.  The phone came on time as expected.  I recommend this company to anyone who is trying to find a phone that your carrier charges way too much for.",5
2,No LTE.,"September 3, 2017",1,"Could not get 4G LTE to work, Checked with AT&amp;T; several times to talk to multiple agents and with Apple but no JOY...Plus battery was very flaky. Sometimes it would hold a charge for almost a day and sometimes it wouldn't last 6 hours. Sometimes  it would say (for example) 70% battery and a few minutes later it would say 35%, then plug it in and immediately it would again show 70%...The seller of this certified reconditioned phone is trying hard to market iPhones at a reasonable price.  Dealfisher is ready to refund and gave me an extra credit for my trouble.I did purchase another iPhone from Dealfisher which I finally got to work. It also had a 4G LTE problem. Looked at the internet and found an answer that worked. Buy a another SIM card and turn cellular data on and off three times. Bingo!...",2
1,Don't buy! Please read!,"July 11, 2017",1,"Do not get this phone please please I'm telling you, the price may fool you but the phone is terrible it freezes, glitches, the battery is bad, and doesn't have a serial number so you can't fix it at Apple or any other stores. Listen to my warning please because I am currently in the process of buying a new iPhone",5
1,keyboard will start typing on its own and bad battery. Didn't find any warranty,"February 3, 2017",1,"Bought for xmas gift and it's already popping up with different applications, keyboard will start typing on its own and bad battery. Didn't find any warranty. :-(",5
5,I got really lucky with this one...,"August 27, 2017",1,"great phone for a really good price at Deal Fisher..Of course there is always some risk when buying refurbished (not new) items, and there are many negative reviews out there..However this iPhone looked only slightly used, i.e. it was accurately described, and battery life is also good (not new but also not too far from it)..This is not a review for the iPhone 6 itself, as there are heaps of other reviews for it already, but all I can say is that it is still one of the best smart phones on the market overall (I did use an Android phone before, but then switched to Apple, as it ""just works"" better overall... (but some drawbacks still exists, namely not to be able to directly transfer e.g. MP3 files to it... I use the work around via Amazon music which also lets you download your own music on to the device, via cloud service.... it is a bit more complicated but ultimately it works)....",2
1,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SOLD BUY APPLE!! IT ...,"February 12, 2016",1,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SOLD BUY APPLE!! IT IS A SCAM!! IT DOESNT DESERVE ANY STARS! I BOUGHT THIS AND RECIEVED EVERYTHING BUT THE PHONE,436
1,"Ok that was my bad, but last week I realize that the phone ...","August 24, 2017",1,"On December 2016 I bought an Iphone 6, I did not realize (because it was written in small letters somewhere down in the product description) that the telephone was refurbished. Ok that was my bad, but last week I realize that the phone screen was lifting from the case (I have never let the phone dropped) I took it to the apple store and they told me the telephone was refurbished and there were some pieces missing like some screws, and the screen was lifting from the case because it was CHINESE  and not an original piece from apple...I am already upset because the telephone was not what I expected but in apple store told me that every telephone refurbished MUST be with original pieces and working perfectly. Also there is a problem with the charging pin so sometimes donâ€™t  get the charge  and it damages  the ORIGINAL  CABLES..WHO IS GOING TO RESPOND FOR THIS FRAUD????..",2
4,Personally great,"June 10, 2017",1,Very good for the price I got mine for 200$ has some scratches on the housing a fray in the screen that can only be seen from a 90 angle view down from the top of it the mute button doesn't work which was the only flaw unmentioned in the statemeant of its condition i wouldn't say it was a perfect purchase but it was a great one I don't regret and I had opened up the iPhone and everything was apple original however I myself have bought an updated jet black housing with an apple logo that lights up white and transferred all the parts and works great even replaced the button with a non apple part and that fixed that the changes I made were about $20 but that was money I just spent to make it unique that most people don't do but over the whole thing was set and had an amazing prize I can't complain to much for my personal experience,2
1,EBWireless has terrible customer service.,"July 17, 2017",1,"EBWireless has terrible customer service...We purchased an iPhone in December 2016, but it began having battery issues about 4-5 months later. We figured it was a problem with app usage or something software related. However, after trying several methods, such as closing open apps, deleting facebook, etc. the battery problems persisted. The battery issue got so bad that the phone would shut down within a few minutes if it was not plugged in. It essentially turned into a corded home telephone...The description of the product stated the phone had been thoroughly tested and inspected and was determined to be ""100% fully functional"" as determined by their ""experts.""  Given that representation, I felt I would be in good standing in returning the phone because it obviously had a defect which rendered it nearly worthless. We did not pay $430 to rent a cell phone for 5 months, which then turns into a corded telephone indefinitely...When I contacted EBWireless about the issue, I received a one line email response: ""Your item is out of warranty."" Nothing else. No greeting. No contact information. Not even a name. When I followed up to insist, here is the response I received via e-mail:..""We do not sell defective phones, you used the phone for over 7 months. Warranty by Amazon's return policy is 30 days but sometimes we give exceptions. Also this item was fulfilled by Amazon not by us, we can not help you.""..Nice...Anyway, I was able to get a full refund from Amazon, so that's nice. Now we need to buy a new phone.....",2
1,Not buying smartphones on Amazon ever again,"May 23, 2017",1,"I got the phone on November 2016. By December the volume down button had stop working and is I don't live in the US I thought it was more of a problem to get it shipped back for a return. Today, May 23rd/17, the home button stopped working all of the sudden. I take very good care of my things and it has always had screen and case cover on. This is either a disposable phone or this company is selling the phones Apple says they are not good after 30 days... being that the time limit for their ""warranty"". I've learnt my lesson: buy it at a place that is willing to offer 1 year warranty.",1
1,Battery was corrupted,"February 26, 2018",1,"When I got the phone I immediately charged it up. It charged to 100% and then I began to use it. The battery only lasted less than an hour and it died at 54%. At first I thought the app I was using crashed the phone. Eventually, I realized it was the battery when the phone progressively died with less and less battery usage. Eventually it got to the point where it would die if I took it off of a charger. I tried solving my problem by buying another phone from this seller. Of course that phone had problems too. It was unable to connect to anything. It couldn't read my sims card or connect to the wifi. I sent that one back but I kept the original phone. I was undergoing a real time crunch. I was about to go away on a trip and needed a working phone. I finally decided to take it into the Apple Store to see if there was anything they could do. Returning this phone would have been even more of a hassle and like I said, I needed a phone for my trip. The Apple Store ran a diagnostic test and confirmed that the battery was completely non-functual. They said they could quickly replace the battery with a new one for $80. When I bought the phone I thought it had a warranty, but of course, since I didn't buy the phone DIRECTLY from Apple, it had zero warranty with them...I wouldn't buy a phone from this seller. Just spend the extra money and get your phone directly from Apple. You will save yourself time and the hassle. You might even save yourself some money...",0
1,Apple iPhone with other pieces in it!,"November 6, 2017",1,"Today, after many weeks with overheating and battery problems, a cracked screen made me go the Apple Store. There, I found out that the screen was not an Apple screen...During the iPhone's analysis, the Genius concluded that - and I quote - ""this phone is has been tampered so much, that it's far from an iPhone"". It had many false parts, and there were a lot of stickers in Chinese inside the phone!! There were pieces missing, and the piece that makes the phone vibrate had 2 screws loose. He stated that there were so many pieces (including the screen) that were NOT Apple, that there was absolutely nothing that could be done through the Apple Store!..Now, this phone - as it states on the receipt received after the purchase - was ""Apple iPhone 6 16 GB Factory Unlocked -.BRAND NEW - SEALED !!!"". Therefore, I demand to have my money sent back to me, because this is FAR from what was agreed!.",1

The phone seems to be new, but it's clearly repacked and the box, envelope with documents inside and plastic wraps on elements in not genuine (THATS FOR SURE)..BUT, the PHONE does seem to be NEW and WORKS FINE as well as LOOKS GOOD. I hope it's not fake or refurbished, because I am going to keep it regardless to the downfalls described above. Overall POSITIVE feedback to the seller and the item..",1
1,Phone Received Was Fake,"April 20, 2017",1,The iPhone that was delivered was a fake that passed for a real one. The main tipoffs were that the content inside made a sound like they were moving around when I used the phone; the serial number on the outside corresponded to the serial number for an iPhone 5s and not an iPhone 6; the camera quality was extremely poor; there was no iCloud integration.,2
1,"Don't buy from them, fake products...","May 15, 2017",1,"There was no warranty along with phone and the charger was faulty since the beginning ( I bought a new charger) and charged phone sufficiently and turned it off. When I took it out it was extremely hot and screen was appereared dead and I tried to turned it on but, it shows no response at all...  wrote so many messages and never got single word from them..Paid $514 which is a big money and its look like I throw out money in a garbage...thank you for never replying me and ripped me off..",1
2,I am really disappointed!!!!,"June 29, 2017",1,"I've bought this Iphone as an brand new Apple. It comes looking like a brand new product. From the box to the device appearance, the charger and the headphones, But it has been not been an ""Apple"" experience at all. I've had 2 Iphone before. With less than 3 months of light use, it started to seriously bug.  I am thinking this Iphone is not brand new... I'm going to take my Iphone 6 to review to an apple store in my country to verify if this is really a new or rebuilt device. This iphone fries frequently, other times it keeps blinking and turns off and turns on the screen ... incredible I have to leave it until the battery is finished. I live in Dominican Republic and I buy it through Amazon because I believe in this online store but I think this can be a fraud.",1
1,I loved it at first until it immediately started to freeze ...,"November 12, 2017",1,"I loved it at first until it immediately started to freeze and would not let me unlock it. Even if I managed to get it unlocked after rebooting and waiting now DAILY it won't even click on an app that I am trying to use. It just opens random apps and will open up my messages and random letters or emojis will start typing. It wasn't a big deal at first because it was occasional but now I can't even get into my phone for the last couple days. I am extremely disappointed and will be contacting seller for a refund. Might as well use the money to fix my iphone 5 screen because other than the screen, I've had no issues with that phone and have had it for years whereas I have only had this one for not even a whole month. Lesson learned, NEVER BUY A REFURBISHED IPHONE!",1

5,The swap worked and I couldn't be happier. Well worth the money and the seller took ...,"January 6, 2018",1,"Item was exactly how seller described. I am a seasoned iPhone user, therefore i am aware of their battery issues (not holding charge after a year or two of use). Being a refurbished phone, the battery was used before. So there was no surprise when this phone would not hold a charge for more than 6 hours and would die before it reach 50% battery life. I contacted the seller about the issue and they had no problem shipping me a battery swap kit. This was stressful as there were delicate connections that needed to be removed and reconnected later. Luckily i knew to youtube a video walk through of the process. The swap worked and I couldn't be happier. Well worth the money and the seller took care of me. definitely buying my next phone here.",0

I am now working with the seller to determine what to do. They are running an analysis on it to see what happened. They have been totally great to work with. I canâ€™t say enough about their excellent customer service. Iâ€™m hoping just this particular phone was a problem because I have had iPhones for several years with no problems at all and have loved all of them.,1
1,Misleading,"December 6, 2017",1,"Phone was adverstized as ""new"" and on the box, but I knew somethibng was wrong when the iPhone started up without requesting any set up as usual.  Then it would not connect to the AT&amp;T; network. Had it verified by AT&amp;T; that my account was provisioned correctly and even with a new SIM card thinking it may be bad and it still would not connect and all phone settings were correct.  Very disappointed. RETURNED FOR REFUND. Would not buy again from this seller.",1

I am hearing that this is a common problem with iphones however the issue was there from the get go so was not fully brought back to a truly working condition.

The solder joints on the board crack, or break. I figured out that if you push on certain areas of the phone, it will work for a short while. It appears that these crooks do this knowing the phone will work for a short while. They sold my son a defective phone, knowing we would chase are tails long enough to let the 1 month warranty run out. Do not purchase from this company.

The phone arrived quickly (Prime same-day), I cut my girlfriend's micro-SIM down to a nano-SIM (carefully) and popped it in, added her Google account with all of her email and contacts, and she was up and running, all within about 15 minutes!..I use an iPhone SE for work, and a Galaxy S6 Edge the rest of the time.  The iPhone 6 is only slightly smaller and lighter than my S6, but it feels much thinner, much lighter, and is so much more comfortable to hold.  The S6 has a larger screen, and WAY more pixels, but the screen on the iPhone 6 looks way better to me.  Just like my iPhone SE, the iPhone 6 lasts all day on a single charge (unless you're playing Pokemon Go), and when the battery finally runs down, it charges back up in no time...Switching between WiFi and 4G (like when leaving my house in the morning) is so much smoother than with my S6.  With the S6, if I'm outside, with poor WiFi signal, I have to turn WiFi off to force the 4G connection, where the iPhone is completely seamless...I switched from iOS to Android after Apple stopped innovating (iPhone 4, 4S, 5, ...), switched from Samsung when they did the same (Galaxy S3, S4, S5), then from HTC when they also followed suit (HTC One M7, M8, M9).  I've been super happy with my S6 Edge for the past year, but I like the iPhone 6 so much, it might be time to make a move back to Apple for my primary, and order one of these for myself!..The only complaint I have is the short, cheap lightning cable Apple ships with their phones.  I ordered some of the 6 ft. Amazon Basics cables (Apple Certified), and I'm expecting them to last at least twice as long as the Apple cable...Other thoughts: 16 GB?!  That leaves less than 10 GB usable after the space required for the OS.  Geez Apple, memory is so cheap!  Add more storage to your entry models or give me a micro-SD slot......",4

1,Looking for a solution,"February 6, 2017",1,"I bought this phone on January 2, It arrived 3-4 weeks later (as everything I order from amazon, I am in Honduras). As I received it the headphone jack was not working, when I plugged in the headphones the sound was very bad quality, I am not even able to enjoy a song (which is really important to me), but the sound that comes out of the iphone is good quality, just not able to listen through the headphone jack. The phone has always been in a lifeproof phone case, it has never been drop, I have not submerged into water and it is new. I was going to let go of the sound problem even though I was dissappointed; but on saturday the touch started giving me problems. Yesterday (sunday) I was not able to use my phone at all  even though I restarted the phone several times to see if that would help, but it did not; even if it did work it would not last for more than 15 seconds. I left the phone alone for the rest of the day and today I turned it on, the touch works when it wants to (and if it does, it just last for some minutes if lucky) and stops whenever it decides. Right now I am not beeing able to use it..I got to the conclusion that the phone came with failures and maybe it is just  my bad luck and the rest of the phones came out good but I really would like to know if there is something I could do about it because honestly I do really need it, and in this condition it is just a waste of money. Please contact me if you think I could send the phone back and get another that works properly..Thanks and bye!..",20

I recieved the phone just as I ordered and there were a few scuffs on the back but nothing severe. No scratches or marks on the front. When I put the case on it looks like a brand new iphone. Came with a chargers and a helpful return reciept. Works with any carrier and is a great deal. HIGHLY SATISFIED!,6

Packaging itself was a bit scary as it was just wrapped up in the typical ""bag"" envelope that has bubble wrap inside it. The phone itself was great. No scratches or dents on it and it worked very well. I ended up reselling it after a week to my father to upgrade to an iphone 6s plus, but he's enjoying the phone still and it has not caused him any problems...The package also came with all accessories you'd normally get with an iphone (wall charger, cable, earpods).

Wasn't sure what to rate this product because I love the phone but this color won't do. It's not really the color of the phone, it what happens to this one and for some reason this one only. On this color/type the camera shifts almost 1/3 to half the way over to the side which is very often and is actually called the #crescentgate or crescent moon club if you'd like to give it a look on google. It hasn't effected the quality of the photo but it's very bothersome and just looks weird. Also, the back camera header fades and also looks strange. I'm not encouraging you to not buy an iPhone. My phone is great!! I'm encouraging you to buy a different color because I did some research and this is the only color of this model that has this problem. Also, it doesn't go with many cases..but that should effect whether you buy it or not.",2

TouchID makes everything easier, the camera is beautiful, this is a fast phone! I have used previous iPhone's but this is definitely the best of them yet! Came brand new sealed in the box, setup was painless. iOS 8.3 has a very user friendly interface, and it is a fast OS for a mobile device at that. The carrier I chose is Straight Talk. I put my SIM card in, called the number on my SIM activation kit, and was ready to go within 5 minutes! No additional effort was required on my part. Having iCloud made restoring all of my settings a breeze, and, if my phone ever breaks, I won't lose any data since iCloud makes a backup every time the phone is plugged in and connected to wifi! The battery on this is amazing! When it arrived, it was at 80%. I drained it down to 2% and plugged it in until 100% for the first charge. I have not charged it since, besides listening to music through USB in my car when driving, and it's been almost a week...The build of this phone is beautiful. I bought a waterproof case to keep it that way.

1,... is my first review which I'm writing because I'm pretty pissed off that this purchase,"July 2, 2016",1,"This is my first review which I'm writing because I'm pretty pissed off that this purchase. I ignored a lot of the other 1 star reviews when I bought this, and turns out they were right...The phone I received was a Japanese model, and everything works perfectly fine on it...except the shutter sound is impossible to disable. I even took it to an Apple store to get the firmware replaced with a U.S. version and that didn't fix the problem either.  Also note that Apple will not replace your phone for you if you buy this phone; they will only give you a replacement if you bought a U.S. version. I have to return the phone now and I'm pretty pissed off...EDIT: I just got off the phone with Apple support. Apparently not only will they not replace the phone for you, they will NOT SERVICE THE PHONE whatsoever in the U.S. either. So if you bring this into the apple store within your 1 year manufacturer's warranty period because of some hardware or software issue, then you will NOT be able to get any assistance with the phone because it is a Japanese model...I am incredibly pissed off that none of this was disclosed to me when I purchased the phone.....",23

I requested an unlock code from AT&amp;T; website 2 days ago as a last ditch attempt. They replied today and said they had approved the unlock and to go ahead and activate the phone..It now works with a non-U.S. SIM card finally so I am hoping it is unlocked for all GSM carriers worldwide..So the phone I received was actually not international unlocked but locked on to AT&amp;T; - even though it was described as factory unlocked for use worldwide.By the way when I contacted the Amazon Supplier they were extremely unhelpful...,8

5,Awesome Phone - worth upgrading!,"September 18, 2016",0,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6s..Camera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions...SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6...Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black...I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all...Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!..Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem...128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g...No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine...IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me...No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand...Hope this helps :)",192

4,6 months' review: iPhone 7 offers a sneak peak into the future -- a future that is worth waiting one more year for.,"December 17, 2016",0,"I got the iPhone 7 on launch day and have been using it daily for about six months now, and here are my thoughts.  A little background on myself: I'm a tech enthusiast who loves mobile computing and how it may enhance our lives.  Two years ago, I switched from Android to give the iPhone 6 a try (here is my review on the iPhone 6 https://www.amazon.com/review/R16NCAQFAEHRRY/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN;=B00NQGP42Y).  After 2 years, a lot has changed in both the Android and iOS systems, and it is worth taking a look at the newest phone from Apple to see how it stacks up...Many other customers have already described the pros and cons of the new iPhone, so I won't belabor all the points but will mention a few that need emphasis...Pros:.- Waterproof.  This is a big one, though Samsung has had it for a few years now.  The iPhone 7 is rated at IP67.  Since this is a brand new feature that Apple is introducing, I'll take some time to explain it.  IP means Ingress Protection, and Ingress just means ""access or entrance.""  Essentially, this rating shows how well protected the device is against different objects that could enter it.  The 67 is actually 2 different numbers rather than just 1 number.  The first number defines solid protection, and 6 is the highest rating (no ingress from solids or in layman's terms, dust tight).  The second number defines liquid protection, and 7 is the 2nd highest rating (out of 8) and it means immersion in liquid for up to 1m.  So you can take this phone into the rain and have no fear.  However, just a note, don't take this to the ocean just yet.  While the device is resistant against water, the seawater is a different story since it has a high salt concentration, and salt can ruin your electronics' ports.  In any case, this is certainly a step forward and something that customers have wanted in a long time.  Just to speak about the competition, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is rated IP68 (which is water resistant, rather than being just water proof).  If you are the average consumer, I don't think you will notice the difference...- Camera.  While the cameras have been improved for both the iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus, it is the 7 Plus that gets the dual camera that allows for extra zoom and portrait mode.  To briefly explain this new feature, the iPhone 7 Plus (not the 7 that is being reviewed here) has 2 camera lenses on the back, one that is 28mm and one that is 56mm.  In layman's terms, one lens has a much better zoom to focus on far away objects while the other lens can take pictures that are much closer (aka wide angle shots).  The dual camera system allows for more clarity and depth of field compared to a single lens camera, and, if you are intrigued to learn more, the dual cameras give the ability to capture what's called ""stereo photography.""  Anyway, if you get the iPhone 7 plus, you can take even better photos, especially portraits where the object/person is focused and the background is blurred.  This is a great improvement for the photographers out there. However, the competition is getting a lot closer than it used to be.  The Samsung Galaxy S7 arguably still has a slightly better camera while the brand new Google Pixel got the highest rating from DxO Mark (a highly reputable review site for cameras)...- Speed.  Snappy and responsive.  The fingerprint sensor is super fast compared to the iPhone 6 and much more so when compared to the iPhone 5s where the TouchID was first introduced.  I won't spend too much time here since many people have commented on the speed.  In essence, because Apple has total control over how apps are implemented and the hardware itself, the phone will feel very fast and fluid.  You can depend on this phone for quite a few years...- Speakers.  They are very nice.  You won't be able to tell that it is a front facing speaker on the top and bottom speaker working together.  They will create a nice sound environment and definitely loud enough to compete with all the other phones out there (and even some of the tablets)...- Battery life held up respectably for me, usually lasting me 1.5 days on a single charge.  I'm not a heavy user, however, so your mileage may vary.  In general, this delivered slightly better battery life than the iPhone 6 for me...Cons:.- Headphone jack.  This is a big drawback on a few levels.  1) There is no immediate benefit to the removal of the headphone jack. Yes, you do get more space for a little more speaker boost, but one can easily argue that most people will listen to their music more via headphones than just out of their phones.  2)  There are no good bluetooth headphones.  Sure, you can argue that some of the top tier headphone makers have nice bluetooth headphones, but those are inaccessible to most consumers because of the high sticker price.  I can't spend 100 bucks on a solid pair of bluetooth headphones, whereas I can spend about 100 to get the ATH-M50's (highly highly rated headphones) and enjoy studio quality sound.  This isn't just the fault of the manufacturers but also because the technology isn't there yet to deliver high sound quality wirelessly via bluetooth.  3) You can no longer listen to music on your headphones and charge your phone at the same time without using an expensive and glitchy dongle.  All of these points add up to inconveniences.  Apple described itself as taking ""courage"" to remove the headphone jack.  That argument is less convincing when you realize that they bought out Beats a while before releasing the iPhone 7...So those are the main points of the hardware.  Here are the points on the software..- The Apple ecosystem is getting tighter.  With the new updates in Apple TV, the new Apple Watch software, and the annual release of the macOS update, it is getting easier and easier to use all of your devices with Apple.  The ""everything just works"" still applies to the software (not to the hardware due to the increasing amount of dongles)..- However, you still can't manage storage well in the iOS.  For instance, my biggest disappointment is the fact that I can't easily delete data from apps.  Instagram may be taking up 900MB of storage because of all the photos that are stored in the app.  Can you just delete them and get on with life?  Not that simple... there isn't an option to do so.  You have to delete the whole app and then reinstall it to recover space..- What's changing is the fact that Apple's iOS now only leads in the ecosystem integration and maybe the number of apps.  Android is closing in fast while Windows is still trying to grow out of its teenage years.  Android is very impressive these days with the introduction of material design a few years ago.  The Android system no longer feels as ""techy"" but is becoming more and more fluid and user friendly..- Siri still lags behind Google's assistant, and that gap is only widening.  Google' AI is so much better compared to Apple.  If you own an iPhone and want to try out Google's latest and greatest, download Allo and give it a try.  You can have a conversation with AI and get responses that relate to the conversation.  You can ask ""who is the quarterback for the Cowboys?""  and then follow it up with ""when is their next game?"" and Google will answer both.  If you asked those 2 questions on Siri, it will not understand the ""when is their next game"" part because it wouldn't know to define ""their"" as the cowboys from the previous question...So, should you buy or upgrade to the newest phone from Apple?..No...Simply put, this is not the iPhone that you should invest money in unless you absolutely need the latest and greatest.  Here are the reasons.  1)  This is not the usual, big upgrade that we expect from Apple's 2-year major update cycle for iPhones.  This is mainly because next year, the iPhone will be having its 10 year anniversary, and you can bet everything you own that Apple will be unveiling a huge improvement at that time.  Rumors include everything from a ceramic casing to an all glass back, to wireless charging, to having dual cameras on the smaller iPhone 8 and not just the 8 Plus.  The list goes on and on, but all the rumors are telling us one thing: if you can wait one more year, this might be the year to wait on.  Sure, you can argue that one can always wait for the next phone.  But this is really true for this year's iPhone since the 10-year-anniversary will lead to a big unveil. 2) The world is slowly adapting to the post-headphones iPhone.  There aren't enough high quality but affordable accessories yet.  Let the market shape itself for a year and you'll get great accessory options with cheaper price tags.  The same goes for bluetooth headphones.  Sure we have some affordable options all over Amazon right now, but the sound quality is no where near a pair of wire headphones.  Also, the Apple's wireless ear buds are nothing too fancy in terms of sound quality, especially considering its price.  3)  The world of apps these days don't always take full advantage of the processing power of the newest iPhone.  This is mainly because the iPhones are so fast and so good these days.  In that sense, your iPhone 6 actually will work fine for a few years longer.  If you are an Android user and thinking about going over to the Apple world, hold off one year.  It'll be worth it...Okay, so I just told you a bunch of reasons for not getting the iPhone, but why the ""4 star review?""  Well, it is still a very well made, functional phone.  I took away one star because of the headphone removal.  Apple usually is good about removing a component when the market is mature enough to accept it.  When it took away the CD slots in MacBooks, the world was already heavily invested in USB drives.  Right now, the bluetooth headphone market is not mature yet, especially in the technology department.  The 3.5mm headphone jack is not on its way to obsolescence, and Apple admitted that when it introduced its new MacBook Pros that still had the headphone jack (and offered a weak excuse that music professionals may still use the headphone jack for other equipment... but iPhone users could be musicians too and use other equipment for certain apps, no?)!  So much for having ""courage.""..The future of mobile computing and personal computing points to universal stands (i.e. USB-C) and going wireless.  Samsung and Google's old Nexus line have had wireless charging capabilities for years, and other Android phones have pioneered the push for USB-C as a universal standard for computing I/O.  Apple has been dropping hints left and right this fall, first with the removal of the headphone jack and then with the introduction of the USB-C into its MacBook Pro line (now both the MacBook and the Pros have USB-C), to signal that it is moving towards universal standards and wireless.  The iPhone can already sync with iTunes wirelessly over WiFi.  Eventually, Apple will have a wirelessly charging phone, and that may occur as soon as next year.  With the iPhone 7, Apple is making a push towards a totally wireless mobile device, and that is an exciting future.  Yet, the world is not ready for that future just yet.  It is up to you whether to embrace that future now and be a dongle warrior or wait to let the rest of the mobile world and Apple's other products to catch up.  If I were in your shoes, I'd wait just one more year...Thanks for reading.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.",33

Calls to AT&amp;T; revealed that the IMEI numbers don't match on the box and the phone.....these number must match.......AT&amp;T; tells me that the numbers I'm giving them are for an iPhone 6s Plus......not the iPhone7 that I have in my hand.....you think that's weird right? Me too.... the home button doesn't work and the whole thing is really strange.... something fishy going on here?!..The IMEI number MUST match the one on the phone.....MUST...... if u buy one of these from this seller.....your not doing ur homework.

5,PERFECT except for that missing headphone jack and tricky home button,"September 17, 2016",0,"I've been using this since 9/16/16 and here's my everyday person impression:..GOOD:.+ water resistant - this is a huge improvement for me!.+increased speed is noticeable w Siri..+the capacity is amazing! (I have the 256) I can keep movies, videos, books, photos, music etc without having to store on iCloud or the like (which usually involves a monthly fee)..+ decent size (same as iPhone 6S) while remaining portable and although not as big as the 7 Plus, it can still fit in pocket..+Widget feature (swiping to right at home screen) has been improved and now allows editing. You can add or delete features which can be key for privacy and being able to customize is always a good thing..+has lots of added fun features in iMessage (not sure if its the updated software or strictly iPhone 7) like memes, automatic replies and being able to write w your fingertip..+camera takes much better pics (increased the megapixels and the difference is noticeable) and it has 5X zoom capability..+has the fingerprint option for quicker access after you enter your 6 digit pass code to begin..+the style and sleekness of the new Jet Black option is a thing of beauty. It's almost criminal to cover it (but necessary for me)..+even slimmer than the iPhone 6 but still able to stand up against something for convenient viewing..+speaker upgrade as it now provides stereo (not up to audiophile standards but still)...BAD:.- no headphone jack!! but box includes dongle (see photo) which inserts into charging port and provides headphone jack - I have a bet with myself on how long it will take to lose. I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones..-the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button. It requires the right amount of pressure and despite offering three different options, not easy. The guys at the Apple Store need to stop showing off - on the bright side, I'm thinking it's a learning curve thing and continued use should take care of this issue...FINAL THOUGHTS: Is it worth the extra money? I'm not so sure but despite the two drawbacks, which I think are a temporary, I'm loving the features and ease of the iPhone 7 and the Jet Black is beyond elegant and sleek. I will provide update after continued usage........",120
5,very nice,"January 22, 2017",1,i bought it from TechnoMaster it came unlocked seald and a1660 model as i want it,1
4,I like the improvements. Giving 4.5 stars,"September 28, 2016",0,"I have both iPhone 6s and 7 and see some improvements...The iPhone 7 is almost identical to the iPhone 6s, but as we all know, lacks headphone jack...The improvements, that Iâ€™ve noticed so far are:..- better battery life.- slightly better photos (especially the ones in low light).- faster processor.- water-resistant.- brighter screen.- louder sound..The thing that took me a while to get used to is a new home button that is not â€˜clickableâ€™ anymore. I must say I preferred the old button. Now, I have the feeling that the click is happening â€˜insideâ€™ the Phone, rather than on its surface..It works perfectly well though...The lack of a headphone jack is a small con for now, since thereâ€™s no many lightning-compatible headphones yet. I hate the dongle so decided on buying the new headphones...They are pricey, but work great. When testing Siri( turns on after double tapping on the earpiece), they pick up voice pretty well, although I tried to speak very clearly..What is interesting, the audio pauses when you pop a headphone out when talking to someone - pretty nice feature..The AirPodsâ€™ battery lasts for 5-6 h of continuous use, although the voice calls use more energy..Iâ€™d recommend getting ones, since their quality is pretty good and they are easy to charge and store ( come with a case that recharges the pieces). The disadvantage is obviously the priceâ€_ Theyâ€™re also easy to loose...Forget about using wired headphones and charging in the same timeâ€_ Unless you want to get another adapter, that will give you 2 lightning portsâ€_  ( Offered by Belkin)..About the water resistivity:..That feature wasnâ€™t meant to be tested but I accidentally dropped my phone to a sink with running water and it surviverâ€_I wouldnâ€™t recommend washing your phone when it gets dirty thoughâ€_..Camera:..Unfortunately, the iPhone7 doesnâ€™t have the second lens( as the iPhone plus has), The selfie camera was improved though, and I see a difference between evening photos taken with iPhone 6s and 7...The sound:..Significantly louder, stereo. (Could hear the music while doing my dishes)...The battery:..The new battery is much better. I can listen to the music almost all day long, browse the internet for a few hours, make couple of calls and use other apps without charging my iPhone7 in the middle of the day..I also noticed that it takes less to fully charge the phone...The Phone performance is quite faster. I feel it while editing pictures or playing games and stream music in the same time...Overall, Iâ€™m happy with the purchase even though I have iPhone 6s. The battery life, sound and water resistivity were convincing enough to give a new model a try...The con is that you must spend additional money on headphones (unless you want to use bangle or Lightning EarPods). The Appleâ€™s wireless headphones are expensive, but definitely high quality...I am attaching a comparison between picture taken with iPhone 6 and 7...",27

5,Is it the best one yet? I think so!,"September 29, 2016",0,"I'm back and it's better than ever..I was in the market for a new phone, and decided since it was the actual launch day, I'd go down to my ATT store and purchase something. I wasn't sure that I would purchase an iPhone 7 (honestly, about 80 percent sure I would) and I waited in line. The whole actual waiting part wasn't as tremendously large as it's quoted as being. I really didn't have to wait all that long, which I think is in part to a lot of people not seeing the potential in this phone...After I purchased the phone, I immediately went and got a Charging case from the same store. This not only allows me to charge my phone, but use my headphones at the same time. I don't have a need for headphones that I can lose (AIRPODS) and I like that Apple actually gives an alternative to you, you get to use corded earpods, and if your battery case is charged (essentially an external battery), you have about 1-2 days of full fledge battery life (and I use my phone a lot) and can still use the headphones...The speed of this one is what amazed me to be totally honest with you. I'm coming back to Apple after a small break and using a GoPhone (ZTE MAVEN) on the postpaid service. The Maven did well honestly, and I kept it around for a lot longer than I usually do. It just worked, and that can't be said for most phones. I'd experimented with iOS10 with my iPad, but I can say, it works a lot better on this than the iPad. Games, videos, even texting, are so much faster, it's hard to believe. The Digital Touch message feature is a nice touch, however, how much I'll use it I've yet to see...Having no physical home button is not a ""biggie"" to me. There is a haptic feedback button in place of this, which is essentially a touch sensitive button, but it actually has a feeling as though you're pressing it. It's kind of how the trackpad works on the MacBooks. A nice touch. It took a little bit to get used to, and choose the ""touch"" I wanted, but after doing so, it's been easy...I'm not displeased as many people would think about the headphone issue, as many people are. I use headphones, but so long as there is a workaround, which Apple has done, I'm not bothered. I can still use the earpods with the lightning connector. I guess it would be an inconvenience to you if your battery-case (if you bought one, or buy one) is dead, and I can actually see that being an issue. But this is why you need to watch battery levels...The camera is EXCELLENT. I've been a photographer for the better part of my life, and can leave my Nikon at home and walk out with this and be confident that any shots I need to take, can be taken with this. HDR is a must...Sound quality with this unit is very good, however, I must say, if you have a screen protector on the phone, you can legitimately feel the sound coming thru the speakers, thru the screen protector. Every phone that has had a screen protector that I've tested on the iPhone 7, has had this issue. All of the floor models that don't are fine. It doesn't bother me tremendously, but for a high end phone, you'd think that design would have been looked at before the phone was released...Overall, I'm pleased, and I think I will be for the foreseeable future. But I usually love almost every phone that I've owned, so, I'm not sure how biased I actually might be. As the experience continues, I'll be sure to update my review with any updates that would be beneficial.",14

5,Faster - Better Camera,"September 17, 2016",0,"i think the 7 or 7 Plus is well worth upgrading to. I have noticed a pretty large speed increase from my iPhone 6s. iMessage is a lot faster and snappier. Safari pages load quicker. Part of it could be iOS 10 which I did not install in my 6s but overall the 7 is faster and everything seems smoother...The lack of a home button has not bothered me at all. They have 3 home button setting, different settings - those seem like they do almost nothing. Mine was defaulted to setting 2 and I left if there. The Taptic feedback in the button area works great...I think the 32g - 128g - 256g is perfect. 32g will get most people by and 128 is plenty. 256 for those taking lots of pictures and videos. I am glad they canned the 16g...The camera is better,  low light shots look way better. I did not get the dual camera 7 Plus but the 7's camera definitely is improved...Colors - I have the Black and it looks awesome, no lines very clean look. The 7's camera is a bigger so it will not fit in most 6 cases. I saw the a Glossy Black and it is gorgeous but scratches easily. Most people will use a case so in the end the colors may not really matter. Only if you want a white from or black but the Black and Jet Black do look great...The 7 is a major upgrade over anything from the 6 on down. If you have the 6s you may want to try out a 7 and see if the speed and camera upgrades are worth it for you......",21
3,An OK phone for almost $1000,"October 27, 2016",0,"The long wait is over and the iPhone 7 is here any ready to be played with. The phone is very similar to the 6s model in the outside appearance. The phone itself is water resistant, but we noticed that it can be used completely under water without a case.  The phone is very durable and can be dropped. After dropping it a few times, the screen is still together, not cracked or shattered.  The battery life on the new 7 is very impressive, we can go an entire day without recharging..Even thou on specs it shows that the 7 has much better hardware, I've noticed that it lags often and at times has no response what so ever for a few seconds..The phone does not come with a head phone jack, sure most people have Bluetooth but when I'm sitting at an appointment waiting for the doctor, I usually don't have wireless headphone with me so can't watch YouTube or play games.  The display looks exactly like the 6s, I cannot tell the difference with my eyes..Overall I was expecting more from a $900 phone.  I can give it only 3 stars as there are just not many new features and there are plenty of phones with much better specs at a fraction of the price..If you found this review helpful please like it at the bottom..",11

4,Awesome phone!,"November 14, 2016",0,"Honestly I love the upgrade I made to the iPhone 7 (from iPhone 6). It is fast with the latest IOS 10 and loving the 128gb. I would not recommend getting the lowest space possible which is 32gb because it sucked having the 16gb iPhone 6. Also they did a study saying the 32gb model is slower as well. The one downside I have about the phone is the phone is missing the headphone jack, but they removed it so the phone could be water resistant and so they could put in a better vibration to the phone. They also removed the home button the takes place in every iPhone before the 7, but they replaced it with a touch button that tricks you into thinking it's a real button. Don't get this phone if you already have the iPhone 6s because it will not be a huge upgrade. PS. The pictures are ones I took on this phone, not pictures of the phone.",4

The camera is better, so that's good news for camera peeps.

4,"Heads up about the new Haptic home button, it doesnt work etip or rubber gloves on","September 27, 2016",0,"THE HOME BUTTON ONLY WORKS WITH BARE HANDS...This means that I can no longer wear gloves while using my phone.  No gloves, not even E tip or rubber gloves.  None of them worked with my phone.  So if you work in the medical field, or as a mechanic keep this in mind.  Heck, even if you live where the weather is cold!  I even had to cut a hole in my arm bands clear plastic cover to access my phone...HERE IS A SOLUTION, ........with extra steps...I just found out there is a tweak you can do if you have to wear gloves:..Go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Accessibility and turn Assistive Touch on...This will add a virtual button that you can move around the screen called Assistive Touch dot.  Then to unlock your iPhone 7, press the sleep button on the right of the phone, then press the Assistive Touch dot, touch the home button and enter your SIX digit pass code...I want to share this with others, just in case they aren't into all of the extra steps to open the phone, because the extra steps are EACH time you have to access your phone...OTHER CONS..1.  I have it on the most sensitive touch and still have to press it rather hard.  It really was so much easier on my iPhone 5.  Also, it keeps opening Siri instead of accessing my home screen.  I have tried it on every sensitivity level..2. While the finger print thing is a cool feature, I have to do it several times before it works.  Then half of the time it ends up opening Siri and I have to shut her down and start over...I love everything else about my new phone and will leave it up to the other, more knowledgeable, reviewers to give you the details on the other aspects.........",15
4,"Miss the headhpone jack, here's a way to charge and use headphones at the same time...","September 21, 2016",0,Not an insane improvement over the 6 but the addition of water resistance is great (and long overdue).  I'm not a fan of the omission of the headphone jack.  This is especially an issue when you want to use the adapter to use your own headphones but also want to charge the phone at the same time (i.e. long flight while watching movies).  There is an adapter that will allow headphones AND charge at the same time (and this is what Apple should of included with the phone)  you can check it out here: http://amzn.to/2cutG5W,18

5,What Everyone Must Know About The iPhone 7,"November 8, 2016",0,"The advanced phone for 2016 has unique qualities, making this phone even better than the last. The buzz has been floating around on whether to invest in this product or not; this product is the iPhone 7. People have a frequent amount of questions that are holding them back from purchasing it. I have always been a fan of the Apple products. They are easy to operate and work fast. Yes, they are spendy, but they are well worth it as long as you take care of them..This model of the iPhone has improved tremendously. Apple has rebuilt the chip for this iPhone, resulting in the functioning speed of the phone increasing. This original chip has made the LTE two times faster than the iPhone 6. Keeping up with the Samsung line of phones, Apple has revised their phones to be splash- and dust-resistant. This is a wonderful benefit; a little water could slow your phone down or even lead to permanent damage..In the additon to the remodeling of the chip and resistance features, Apple has also giving the home button a new look. Now the home button is stronger and sturdier, preventing it from breaking when dropped or tossed around, which has been a problem with the previous iPhone. The outcome from dropping your iPhone could result in the button becoming loose or falling out and the malfunction of the Touch ID. The new home button is pressure sensitive making it more responsive to your touch making it easier to open your phone. The phone responds back to you with a customized vibration when opened.  The home button has been reengineered, making your Touch ID more secure and faster. There are some things to consider however. The glass screen goes all the way to the corners of the phone. Given that, when you drop this phone and it bounces from corner to corner or lands face down, it could shatter the screen. This could cause your front camera to malfunction or even permanently damage your phone..A vast topic that has been discussed immensely among my friends and I has been about the removal of the headphone jack. Some said that it was foolish of Apple to do something like that. Teenages cherish the use of music. They use it very often throughout the day while doing different activities. They feared the lack of the headphone jack would bring extra unnecessary expenses for wireless headphones. If you are uncomfortable with the wireless headphones, Apple has made a solution for you. The iPhone 7 provides a cord that has the headphone jack at the end. All you have to do is insert this two-inch cord into the charger portal. If you are in favor of the wireless headphones, Apple provides you with your first pair with the purchase of the iPhone 7. If youâ€™re not much of a headphone person and just like to blast your music, the new â€œstereoâ€ù feature allows you to enjoy music better than ever. I have fantastic news for you: this new stereo is twice as loud as the one in the iPhone 6. There is a speaker located at the bottom and top of the phone, allowing the sound to travel around the room, making it louder. The iPhone 7 is the first device in Apple to have a stereo speaker implemented to one of their phones..Furthermore, iPhone owners have received an entirely new camera. There are now two cameras that shoot at once to give you an astonishing and lively photo that appears in HD. I truly admire this feature, coming from a teenager who enjoys taking pictures to capture memories. This camera is a great asset to any iPhone owner that cherishes every memory they hold and want to have it in a high quality photo. Based off an unanimous review on the CNET website, customers from Apple really enjoy having optical image stabilization. Along with that, the new camera delivers improved photos, especially in low light..Have you ever been in a situation when you want to capture the moment to have the memory forever only to find youâ€™re out of storage space and cannot take a picture? There are new GB that are larger (128 and 256), giving you the ability to store more on your phone. No more worries about having to go through your pictures every month to get them printed off or about having to delete them. With this extra storage, you will never run out of storage. Additionally, one thing I absolutely admire since I'm a teenager is the battery life. When I had the iPhone 6, I had to charge my phone up to two or three times a day. I always had two portable chargers with whenever I was away from home. The battery life on this phone is out of this world. If you aren't on it often, it could last you up to two days before it dies. If youâ€™re a busy teenager like me, always doing something on your phone, the charge lasts throughout the whole day. No more having to carry bulky portable chargers around. CNET also states how wonderful the battery life of this iPhone is; this just further proves how worthwhile the purchase of this advanced phone is..Apple has made minimal, but effective changes to the specifics of the iPhone 7. They have created new colors for this phone including new black and jet black. The size of the iPhone 7 is equal to that of the iPhone 6 with its length and width; it is a bit thinner due to the fact that it lacks an auxiliary jack. The iPhone 7 is also available in the plus size for people who like a bigger screen. The display on the phone is the same so you donâ€™t have to get use to a new display format. Following that, the brightness of the screen has improved immensely. This new quality has brought colors alive, making them bolder and lively. The IOS display and features is the same throughout all Apple products; your iPhone 7 automatically comes in the newest IOS form..The overall review for this phone is an eight point seven out of ten. Based on reviews from others, they seem to really enjoy this phone along with everything it offers. Iâ€™d say you are getting your money's worth. Iâ€™ve had the iPhone 7 for a couple months now and I haven't had any problems with it. I love the advanced technology it offers. The extended battery life and the new camera is the overall reason to purchase this phone. A bonus feature to me is the new stereo speakers it has because Iâ€™m a teenage who listens to music every chance I get; these new speakers are insane. Your music is loud and fills the room. Apple has really thought out of the box on this phone. If you aren't an Apple lover yet, then join the Apple family and get the iPhone 7..",3
5,The philosophy of continuous improvement,"July 29, 2017",0,"As a several yearsâ€™ iPhone user, a washing machine-related mishap with my 5s led me to upgrade to the new 4G iPhone 7...The regular 7 is the ideal size to fit your pocket and very lightweight, but a larger version of the phone is available for avid gamers who like a bigger screen and which has more camera functions too, with a Â£100 price premium...The main takeaways:..1. The iPhone design as ever is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use. The 7â€™s case-colours are subtle and classy-looking with black, grey and metallic pastels endowing the phone with a quality image..2. The screen is a big leap forward from the 6, with clear bright graphics and allowing you to choose icon and text size (perfect for those of us whose vision isnâ€™t quite as sharp as it used to be). The regular 7 seems to have finally got the balance right between a good usable screen size and convenient portability..3. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, using the phone in landscape format has the effect of widening the keypad..4. The ring tone &amp; speaker volume is clearer &amp; louder on the iPhone 7 than any of its rivals..5. The new cordless airpods sense when theyâ€™re in your ears and pause when you remove them, so finally an end to earphones with trailing cables..6. The iPhone 7 is splashproof and may be immersed in water for a time without damage; Apple though does not guarantee the phone will remain undamaged if it is accidentally left in a pocket and subsequently endures a complete wash/spin cycle..7. Thereâ€™s no doubt about it, the new dual camera system on the 7 is fantastic..8. There are three options for memory capacity (naturally with rising price tags as you go up): 32G, 128G and 256G. I would suggest that unless youâ€™re continuously streaming hi-def videos and downloading big games, 32G is going to be enough for most users with a storage capacity such that youâ€™re unlikely to ever need more..9. Everything you do on the phone including your contacts may be backed up on the i-cloud, so should your phone be lost and not recovered, a new one may be easily reconfigured with your preferred settings and contact database..Gripes: very few -..1. The battery life isnâ€™t great but is an improvement on the 5 and 6, and moreover you can now buy a phone case incorporating 24-hours of extra battery life, though it makes the phone more bulky..2. The price of the 7 is high for a buyer on a modest income, but as usual you get what you pay for and this is a premium product..Itâ€™s easy to see why Apple maintains market leadership with such excellent products and back-up service through their funky high street/mall Apple stores full of knowledgeable, intelligent and helpful staff. Make sure you buy a screen protector and a silicone rubber-back case to protect the sides of the phone in case it gets accidentally dropped on the street â€“ which it eventually will...Finally, some one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked or otherwise non-functional phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. One solution is to buy from an Apple store; theyâ€™ll set up the new iPhone for you, transfer all your contacts, settings and data from your old phone and be available to resolve any subsequent issues..",1

1,I hate the 7; buy a 5 instead,"January 29, 2018",0,"The iPhone 7 is a serious step backward by Apple.  Prior to this, my biggest complaint was the battery life.  However, I could have the phone plugged in charging, while listening to music on my headset or talking on the phone.  With only 1 plug now, instead of 2, you can either charge your phone OR use your headset, but not both.  Further my old headsets do not fit the 7, and the 7 headset won't fit my iMac.  I bought two splitters and adapters and the splitters did not work, and the adapter is hard to keep up with...Second, the touch screen is insensitive and about 1/3 of my touches are not detected.  There is a heavy and a light touch but when holding the phone with one hand and / or typing quickly, you cannot control the different touch levels...In the past, when you bought an Apple product, you got a solid operating system that had been thoroughly tested and you did not have to update all the time.  Not anymore; you can spend as much time updating your phone and apps as you spend using it now...Many of the new features are a nuisance unless you are a teenager, and you cannot turn them off, and they constantly try to cram the Apple Subscription Music service down your throat. I want to turn that feature off, and not be asked about it another hundred times...I loved my old iPhone 5 despite the short battery life.  Given the computing power of the phone, I could understand that, and had back up battery packs I could use.  But I hate my iPhone 7 and would highly recommend against buying one...",0
4,Improvements over the 6S!!,"September 23, 2016",0,"The iPhone 7 offers some incremental upgrades over the 6S. Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note...- Better display (wider colour gamut).- Better taptic engine.- 5 grams lighter.- IP67 Water and dust resistance.- Way better A10 Fusion CPU.- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p).- Rear camera have OIS.- Better low light performance.- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE.- Slightly better battery life.- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)..The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note. Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!.",7

After 6 month it does not work anymore (touch screen does not work well, main home button does not work at all). I contacted the seller who did not help me and did not accept return or refund. Keep in mind that according to APPLE, the manufacture give you only few month of warranty while the seller has to guarantee 2-year warranty. With this seller and Amazon you have only 45 days warranty!!! So after that time frame (e.g. your iphone breaks 12 months after you buy it) you have not protection from Amazon and you just waste your money. So be careful.",6
5,Another Apple product to add to my collection,"October 19, 2016",0,"I have owned iPhone since the release of the 4 and have never found another phone that I like to make me consider jumping ship to another company. I upgraded to the Jet Black 128GB iPhone 7 from a 6 so there are certainly many features that were added...Pros:.-Very fast...noticeable difference in speed. ****FYI: MANY PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE THERE IS A DIFFERENT IN SPEED BETWEEN THE 32GB and other models. SO if you didnt buy it yet keep that in mind. For the extra storage, more powerful camera and speed its worth the additional $100.****.-Nice color options (love my Jet Black).-Battery life is improved. I get through a whole day of use with no issues and normally have at least 25% left at the end of the day..-Camera on the front is now almost the same quality as the rear camera on the 6.-New home button feels more responsive.-Finger print scanner opens with no hesitation...Cons:.-Jet Black does hold finger prints very bad...so if your anal about that you may want the other models outside of the black ones. Both attract finger prints equally but the Jet Black does scratch a little easier. Just keep it in a case OR get a naked skin if you prefer the no case look, problem solved!.- Headphone jack - I wouldnt say this is a full con....rather a life style adjustment. The first 2 weeks I did have several 'son of a b****!' moments where I didnt have my dongle. I keep the apple provided one in my car attached to my AUX cord and have no issues. Charging in the car is not something I do so this has not bothered me that you cant do both...",0
1,Total rip-off these phones are defective.,"November 12, 2017",1,"I bought this phone back in February and it developed a hardware issue. My phone (Iphone 7 128GB) recently developed an issue in cellular signal, still searching for network and could not recognize the carrier, so i did a reset of network settings and restart the phone then the screen goes to black and white lines and the phone restart itself continuously tell i remove the SIM card or put it in airplane mode, and i have been tried another SIM cards but the problem still exist..Thereafter, i connect it to ITunes and ITunes told me that you have to update phone to IOS V. 11 but actually i already updated my phone to IOS V.11. then i tried to update the phone but unfortunately the process failed with the unknown error (-1) and the phone currently stuck in a recovery mode and also i tried restore process and face the same error. I took very good care of this phone bear in mind, it's in near mint condition. So disappointing that they do this to people. Never buy a phone off of Amazon, its too much of an investment to risk buying from these shady sellers. Buy it from your carrier, get a protection plan and warranty otherwise you'll be stuck with a $800.00 piece of metal and glass and the seller will tell you ""It's your problem now, sorry.""

1,iPhone 7 is a disappointment to me,"November 13, 2016",0,"As an iPhone user for 5 years, iPhone 7 is a disappointment to me. Apple officially introduced its next-generation of smartphone. The company claimed their new iPhone as the best one they have ever released. It is equipped with a more powerful processor, upgrades in camera performances, the strips at the back are more reasonably laid out, a new special color, and the removal of the 3.5mm audio jack...Apple used to be the leading company in innovation of its product that took over the smartphone market a couple of years ago. But now Apple charges hundreds of dollar for an iPhone 7 which has mostly the same functions compared with an iPhone 6. My friend bought an iPhone 7 right after it was released and it looks exactly the same with the iPhone 6. Both devices have the same screen size, same display solution, same processing system, and slightly bigger camera...The biggest problem of iPhone 7 is the iOS 10. Force Touch technology enhances the touch sensitivity on the device, and this enhancement have been used on devices such as the Apple Watch, and the trackpad on MacBook. However, in this operating system iOS 10, when Force Touch is used to reply to messages from the lock screen, the screen would become stiff. The only way to solve this is to restart the device. iOS 10 also has problems with Reduced Motion. This is a new function for users to create an iOS 3D motion display on the lockscreen wallpaper. But the use of iOS 10 Reduced Motion will cause other applications like Safari to slow down or inoperable. I havenâ€™t mentioned about uploading videos and photos on Facebook will force the application to stop working, soundbar speakers outside interference even with plug connector along with 3.5 mm standard headphone speakers, reboot sudden catastrophe, Siri function is unstable when asked the name often throw out, bluetooth audio stutters tone and screen lock sound unquenchable, and self-disconnecting device with accessories...Lastly, the removal of the 3.5 mm audio jack. This change is unnecessary. Bluetooth headphone development in smartphone brands including iPhone has been introduced a long time ago. So why did Apple remove headphone jack? Is this the way for Apple to charge more additional cost on its customers? The price of an iPhone climbs up every year and now customers have to pay more money to buy the Airpods or Earpods with Lighting connector. Now you are only get to choose listen to music or charge your phone, the only way to listen to music and charge your phone is buying a 150.00$ Airpods set. iPhone 7 is a good product with pretty strong processing system and nice looking design, there is no doubt about that. But is it worth to spend 780.00$ plus an additional cost of 150.00$ for a phone that you can spend the same amount of money and buy a high-end smartphone that has the same functions or even better of other brands that cost only about 500.00$-650.00$ or so like Samsung, Sony, and LG..",8
5,A worthy phone..,"October 10, 2016",0,"I bought this phone about 3 weeks back from my carrier. I was an android user and moved to iPhone..My first thoughts on this:.Design - This phone has a similar design to that of the iPhone 6s except the antenna lines at the back and the minor camera bump. Overall the design of this phone is phenomenal. It looks premium yet sturdy. I bought this in Matt Black and it looks premium. It gives a totally different look for this phone as the whole phone including the screen is in black..Hardware - The hardware specs of this phone are of top notch. Its one of the fastest phone in the market and I can clearly feel it when I compare to my old Nexus 5. The fingerprint unlock is so fast and snappy that it has almost zero lag from humans perception..Software - With iOS 10 there are couple of worthy improvements in this phone. One of them is the swipe right to get the general information about things to do. This is similar to the android's google now on right swipe. iMessage is the best messaging experience on any phone or platform. One feature I miss is the swipe on type which would make it really easy to type some common words. Although autocomplete for apple keyboard is pretty good but swiping made things much better for common words..Camera - The camera of this phone is one of the best. Although I was a bit confused between 7 and 7 plus due to the dual camera, I went with this phone for its size. The camera is instant at taking pictures and photos in low light are fantastic..Battery - I am impressed with the battery of this phone as of now. It lasts a whole day without charging.",1
1,Good hardware but the operating system leaves a great deal to be desired - better to go with Android phone,"November 9, 2016",0,The operating system is still not finished and it takes more than 10 minutes to establish a wi-fi connection. Whether at home or at the office or a public hot spot I find myself waiting for up to 15 minutes to get a WiFi data connection. Apple tech support people are clueless about networking devices and have recommended deleting all network connections which did not help or doing a full reset of the phone which wasted 2 days to download everything all over again and still did not help...Updates are more than 1GB for the operating system and over 2GB for iTunes which is needed to do any sort of backup from the iPhone to a computer and Apple's trying to force everything through iTunes is as dumb a design as Microsoft's reliance on the registry...Strongly recommend buying an Android OS based smartphone like the Pixel from Google. The Apple smartphone operating system leaves a lot to be desired if you want to connect to the internet or a local LAN and not rely 100% on cellular data with its high cost and slow speeds..,7
5,... already I can say I have grown to really like the phone compared to the ones before,"September 27, 2017",0,"Being a previous generation iPhone user and after having the iPhone 7 for over a year already I can say I have grown to really like the phone compared to the ones before. The most notable improvements from the generations before are the photo quality. It was a huge jump going from an 8 mega-pixel camera to a 12 mega-pixel camera, as well as adding the live picture feature to take pictures while in motion and still get a clear image. Although it is not the best camera because the new Samsung galaxy s8 has a 12 mega-pixel camera built in as well. The battery life has significantly increased from the 6 to the 7 as well, I know this first hand because I have owned both and when I had my iPhone 6 the battery life lasted me maybe a half a day and now with the 7 I can go through a full day doing the same activities with my phone on the same charge. Another interesting feature is the water resistance of the new iPhone 7; in the past, I have gone through two iPhone 6 that have been ruined by water damage and since I have had the 7 I have fallen victim of a prank in which my friends threw buckets of water drenching my clothing and my phone was in my pocket. I pulled out the phone and to this day there are still no signs of water damage whatsoever. A new and interesting feature in the new models of the iPhones are the stereo speakers and they give a clear crisp sound as compared to the speakers in the iPhone 6. Of course, every good thing will still have its flaws and any company has yet to make the â€œperfectâ€ù smartphone. The flaws in the iPhone 7 are that they removed the headphone jack and everything runs through the charging port of the phone. This is a real pain in the neck because you would have to choose between charging your phone or listening to music unless you purchase an adapter or of course if you have Bluetooth accessories. All being said, I would definitely recommend this product to people.",1
1,No bang for buck,"October 28, 2016",0,"For how much i paid, the features are nominal. Can't charge and use headphones at the same time. It doesn't really sound much better either. The performance is comparable to older models and cheaper non-apple products and doesn't really stand out. I've used a lot of devices too. You pay for the apple name but not really a superior phone. As far as the headphone jack goes, a tech at the apple store said it was made this way to enable its water resistance. The new samsung phones are water resistant and still have headphone jacks. If, for apple, the technology to do both doesn't exist for them yet, they need to stop dragging ass. Now the screen. Good screen i guess. Not as good as the oled of samsung tho for sure. Handheld oled has atleast been around since the 2012 G1 Psvita which looked AMAZING. it was only $250 back then too. The performance and responsiveness are very good but unfornately for apple that's the norm across the board (nexus lg samsung etc). Comparable performance with inferior hardware and display for more $ than another brand was a poor desicion for me. I was simply just not impressed and quite frustrated trying to use the device compared to samsung or lg. One star for functioning as advertised (aka its a phone and will work as such when you need it to)",8
5,The Pinnacle of the iPhone Experience,"October 4, 2016",0,"Design..This is the best looking iPhone yet in my mind. First off the antenna lines on the rear of the phone are moved more to the top and bottom of the phone and blend in more than they did on the iPhone 6/6S. Even better, if you have the black or jet black versions, they donâ€™t really show up at all. Overall, it looks similar to the 6/6S, but feels like the final, evolved version of the design. The size feels great and overall, it is just a beautiful phone...As stated above, the iPhone 7 has added both black and jet black colors. They havenâ€™t utilized a true black color since the iPhone 4/4S, and these new colors truly look so much better than the space gray of old. Also as mentioned, they almost completely hide the antenna lines which is a huge plus. My personal pick would be the jet black, but the regular black looks much better in real life than it does on the Apple website where it looks more gray than it truly is. You can also still get the phone in gold, silver, and rose gold variations...The home button is now not an actual â€œbutton,â€ù but utilizes the 3D touch like capability to simulate the idea you are pressing a button. The settings options gives three different modes to simulate this, and after only a day, I completely got used to it. The fingerprint sensor is as fast as ever which makes unlocking your phone a consistent and seamless experience. I have faced very few occasions where my fingerprint didn't accurately register...The iPhone series has officially become waterproof! By doing this, it makes me feel so much more secure in just the day to day tasks of using my phone. If Iâ€™m caught in a rainstorm, it is reassuring to not have to tuck the phone and run like a football player. It is also dustproof and is rated IP67 which means it is certified to be resistant for up to three feet for thirty minutes...Camera..The rear camera is stronger than ever on the iPhone 7. It has an improved 12MP camera that takes excellent pictures. The regular version of the iPhone finally has OIS (optical image stabilization) just like its big brothers, the Plus series. The pictures it takes are clear, capture a great amount of light, and due to the OIS, rarely come out blurry. The camera loads lightning fast and is overall just a spectacular camera...The front camera also took another bump up to 7MP. The combination of the improved resolution, consistent retina flash (front flash), and speed are excellent on the front camera. I still wish it had a wider field of vision, but other than that, I have no complaints about the front camera...Display..The Retina display is the same as it has been since the iPhone 4. 326 pixels per inch is a good looking display. It certainly does not compete with some other phones and their higher resolution screens, but for now, the screen still gets the job done. I would like to see them improve this in the next installment, but it is still a pleasing screen to view at 4.7 inches...The brightness is outstanding and it also drops very low too, which is a benefit if you are trying to read something in a dark room. According to Apple the brightness is better than ever, but I have not noticed any discernible difference in that area...Audio..The audio is excellent. It finally has stereo speakers where sound comes out the bottom right speaker grill and the top speaker on the front of the screen. Having stereo speakers, along with a front facing one makes such a difference when listening to music or watching a video. It sounds great and just makes the listening experience so much more enjoyable.  This is certainly one of the biggest improvement areas over last year. Also, in terms of the big headphone jack controversy, it does actually come with a lightning to 3.5mm converter, so you can still use headphones with it...Battery..Battery life has improved over the 6S and SE. On daily use, I have gotten a couple more hours of use per day. I would still welcome faster charging options, but this is a nice step up from previous generations. It has increased to 1,960 mAh battery which makes a difference...Functionality..This is the pinnacle of the IOS software experience. The 2GB of RAM, the A10 processor, and the implementation of IOS 10 is great. Everything runs well and quickly. Also, the fact that the storage sizes have all doubled to 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB is fantastic, as 16GB is a very antiquated notion. Expandable storage would be welcome, but due to how IOS is more locked down and for monetary reasons, I understand why that wonâ€™t most likely be a feature in the near future...The software is clean, smooth, and works well. There are still a few pet peeves such as not being able to close all the apps down at once or not being able to make simple changes such as changing the color of text messages instead of just grey, blue, and green without jailbreaking the phone. But that is also part of its strength. Everything on the phone has been glossed to a high sheen, and almost everything runs well. IOS is simple, straightforward, and I look at it like a menu at a restaurant: it may not have the largest selection or allow you to ask for substitutions, but what you did get is mostly excellent...If you would like to read more of my reviews, please check out: smartphonehaven.com...",4
3,Wait For the Redesign of the OLED model,"August 5, 2017",0,"Iphones are the best but stay away from this one and the 2017 model. Here is why:.1. No headphone adapter included in box. 3.5mm jack is gone..2. The OLED display which is Much superior to IgzO lcd display Apple will buy from Samsung in 2018.3. Software/Firmware is out of date compared to Android 8..4. It's a downgraded version of Iphone 6S but an upgraded version because of Gorilla Glass protection in the Iphone 6S..Samsung has gained ground over Apple because of their displays..But since Apple is Buying OLED displays, which I find exciting news, in 2018 there will be a new generation of Iphones since the Iphone 6.",0
2,I was hoping for better.,"March 8, 2017",0,"Iâ€™ve had my IPhone 7 for close to a month now, and feel like I know it well enough to write a knowledgeable review of it. My previous phone was a BlackBerry Z30..First I have to say is that Iâ€™ve been working at a factory on a 20 plus acre complex that employs about 700 people in Worcester MA for 6 years now. It is common knowledge among us, that the only carrier with a constantly reliable signal at this plant is AT&amp;T.;.That having been said, my Z30 could go on Verizonâ€™s network with a signal  anywhere from no signal to 2 bars of 4 G, with the average being about 1 bar of 3G, and no signal being more common than a 4 G signal..The IPhone 7 is much worse. The range is between no signal to 1 bar of 3 G, the average being about 1 bar of 1X, and no signal being the most common of all. I could just shut it off, itâ€™s that bad. I really didnâ€™t know I had it so good with the Z30..So, if you plan on using this phone in a weak signal area, I would recommend you get different phone, because this phoneâ€™s antenna is also weak!.Next is, I miss the BlackBerry Hub, all communications in one place. Phone, e-mail and messaging, all together in chronological order, or separate also in order..Iâ€™ve installed Yahoo mail and get widgets of my e-mail on my home screen. Usually just one line of each new e-mails, but doesnâ€™t get fully down-load it into e-mail app. So, if Iâ€™m at work and get an e-mail I want to read in its entirety, I have to wait for my hopefully 1 bar of 1X to do it. The Appleâ€™s e-mail app was just as bad, it just doesnâ€™t do the widgets. Not HAPPY! My old BlackBerry put everything into the hub without me asking for it to do it! When there was no signal, it would constantly look for one, and when it found one, it would do whatever was needed to be done. No input from me needed. It also had the battery power to do it all day. Happy with the IPhone battery so far..I also donâ€™t like that everything the IPhone does is cloud based, I get next to no signal 45 plus hours a week, the cloud is useless!.If I sound like I miss my old BlackBerry. I do, but Iâ€™m still trying my best to adjust to this IPhone. The jury is still out..",0
3,Headphone jack idiocy!,"May 27, 2017",0,"The phone is beautiful and works great, however getting rid of the headphone jack is the stupidest thing they'be could've done. This is trying to find a solution to a problem that did not exist... who are/were the people that we're complaining about the 3.5 mm? So basically I can't listen and charge my phone at the same time, or have to buy an additional cord with two tails, if I want to use any high end 3rd party headphones, car connections, etc, you have to have this stupid little cord attached to the phone always.  The phone looks absurd with two little tails dangling of it. This is a great phone until someone very stupid tried to simplify the phone and ended making it less functional...  this bothers me everyday. I give it 3 stars because when you don't have to use the headphones the phone is great. I hope they reverse course, or I may really consider going to android...",0
2,"no apple, you STILL can't play the SLR card","January 9, 2017",0,"I'm still offended by Apple playing the SLR card...Even the iphone 6 at its 8MP actually looks better than the iphone 7 at 12MP for macros, and other outdoor shots...The stabilization added in the 7 will help but in any form of action shot, it would be blurry and under low light indoors, all iphones are quite poor...I doubt we'll see a xenon flash on the iphone 8, perhaps the 9? This of course leaves the Lumia 1020 pureview 41mp a superior shot and actually the stabilization is better there too. Alas, there is not always an app for that, with windows mobile...If you have an older iphone, wait it out.  Grab a pentax q-s1 for cheap and fun shots (along with a wifi SD card).",0

5,The best Phone Period,"June 24, 2017",0,"This is Phone is absolutely amazing. I have been an avid iPhone user since the start. Apple has definitely done it again with the iPhone 7. The screen is amazing. The resolution and color contrast are on point. The new haptic feedback, is is useful and versatile allowing Apple to make the phone completely waterproof. The phone is super fast and never hickups or anything regardless of what I throw at it. You have to love the amazing customer service Apple provides anytime you have an issue or don't know what to do. Effeminately the best phone on the market and kills any Android.",0
3,"Camera : dull depressing colors, unattractive selfies.  Needs color photo software upgrade.","May 1, 2017",0,"Good : 1) dual lens zoom and 2) fingerprint sign in are more useful and convenient than I expected...Camera : dull depressing colors, unattractive selfies.  As a photographer/shutterbug, I was very disappointed.  The so called 'natural' colors make pictures boring and ugly.  Trees and grass have dull dirty green.  Selfies skin tones are yellowish, brownish and unhealthy looking, like there's jaundice.  Wrinkles are pronounced.  Lens has a face widening, fattening effect.  Lens distortion.  For these reasons I am considering of selling my 7+ for a Samsung S8+.  7+'s Low light is terrific for a camera phone.  But when I read it is DSLR level, nonsense.  When other cameras phones give beautiful pictures, selfies, have beautifying software, iphone 7 is left in the dust.  Pictures and selfies to many consumers are VERY important...Minimal VR support.  Another reason I am thinking of selling the phone for a Samsung.  Even though Samsung is not a nice company...7+ uses LCD screen when even my mid range Samsung J7 has OLED and much deeper blacks.  Iphone 7+ screen is beautiful but the blacks are not as deep...Not much technological and design innovation.  Just a nice 'luxury' item.  Apple needs to up their game...",0
5,Wow!

The extra 2 hours of battery life is a bonus.  The surprise is that the fingerprinter reader is so much more accurate with dry hands, and sweaty hands.  Another surprise is that I can set home button to triple click to bring up the magnifying glass app so I can read fine prints..",0

4,Great Phone,"September 21, 2017",0,"The iPhone 7 is a great phone for everyday tasks.  The phone has a very solid build with a metal back and a matte black finish that doesnâ€™t slip in your hand.  The matte black also doesnâ€™t show fingerprints like most shiny phones do.  The front of the phone is a durable glass that does show fingerprints but cleans easily and is scratch resistant.  The power and volume buttons are placed nicely on the sides where they are rarely accidentally pressed but can be easily pressed when needed.  The overall size of the phone is great with it not being too large where you canâ€™t access all of the screen with one hand but is still large enough to easily read any text and watch any videos..The iPhone 7 also has a new home button that doesnâ€™t physically move like previous iPhoneâ€™s did.  Having previously owned an iPhone 6 the button is very different on this new phone but is very easy to get used to.  The amount of haptic feedback is adjustable so you can make it feel exactly how you want.  After just a few hours with the phone the new home button seemed just as natural as the previous home button.  Included in this home button is a fingerprint scanner that is much faster than the scanner in the previous phones..Although the iPhone 7 was the first iPhone without a headphone jack, it isnâ€™t a large issue for day to day use.  There are many Bluetooth headphone options that allow you to listen to music or other media while also charging your phone.  Since the phone doesnâ€™t have an audio jack there is another speaker on the bottom that makes the speaker quality much better and louder than previous iPhones..The front and rear facing cameras on the phone are both very good for their respective tasks.  For those looking for a more professional photograph the iPhone 7 plus may be the better option.  For the everyday user that isnâ€™t serious into photography they both take very good pictures..Overall the iPhone is a great improvement from previous generations of iPhones.  The overall build quality and design make it a very good looking and durable phone.  This phone is great for those who use their phones for everyday communications, playing games, and just about every other task a smart phone can do...",0
5,I absolutely love Apple I was living off an iPod touch on ...,"February 10, 2018",0,"Not a single regret about this Apple product, it makes life a whole lot easier. I absolutely love Apple I was living off an iPod touch on Wi-Fi for 2 years before I even got an official iPhone. I have had the iPhone 7 128GB for about 10 months now about almost a year. It has given me no problems whatsoever in the time span that I have had it for. I have the matte black 128GB regular iPhone it is so amazing for my school life and job I can multitask everything. The battery on the iPhone 7 is so amazing it last the whole day even when I am scrolling through social media and listening to music. The iPhone comes in 2 choices for memory and that is probably the sucky part you have to choose between a 32GB or a 128GB for the difference of 100$. Apple is an amazing company but the GB thing is what mostly everyone ever really complains about. The iPhone does not have expandable memory like android with an SD slot.  Before switching to the iPhone 7 I had the iPhone 5 and that was a 64GB which they don't offer as an option of phone memory anymore so I went for the 128GB because I knew I was going to need all that memory. Another bad thing is that it is â€œWater Resistantâ€ù not â€œWaterproofâ€ù, it can get wet just not as much as you'd like before it is considered water damage. If you want to protect your prestigious phone I recommend protection for it such as a case or a glass protector..The upside of the iPhone 7 was that Apple has its products already built in with virus protection built in the price. If I were to get on a prohibited website or such content like that the phone would either warn me or straight up kick me out of it. The phone never really freezes with so much happening on the inside of it. The camera is so amazing on the phone it captures absolutely everything. The documents are stored inside your iCloud so if anything were to happen to your iPhone and you needed a new one you could just sign in with your credentials and you would have everything back in a second. I just love my iPhone so much itâ€™s so dependable when I need it the most. I recommend trying it out at least once in your life and just see how well youâ€™re taken care of..",0
5,"iPhone 7, never AGAIN","December 12, 2016",0,"Up to now you could trust a new iPhone release, without â€œtouchingâ€ù the new one. Since iPhone7 everything looks different. There is no difference now in design between iPhone 6 and iPhone7, worse the new iPhone 7 is thicker and heavier. The new innovations on iPhone7 are few and for a standard user forgettable. E.g. a professional photographer takes a SLR anyway, and a Pro Diver doesn't take his Phone to the Sea. For that reason, the loudspeaker connection is also missing and you have to carry another stupid cable. And I will never use that stupid wireless earphones. Should I stick them to my ear during running ?  I already regret that I transferred to the iPhone7. And the sh ... Home button is a horror. The whole phone vibrates like a surprise egg. IPhone7 never again, sorry Apple, maybe next time again. And then only after extensive tests of the new release.",1
5,Does everything very well in a nice slick package,"December 31, 2016",0,"No complaints. Does everything very well in a nice slick package. I bought mine from one of my carrier retailers stores, but it's the same unlocked version as directly from Apple or resellers. Be sure to verify 1660 for 7 or 1661 for plus. Everyone has personal preferences but most reviews are nitpicking minor stuff at this point. So no headphone jack. I was concerned about that but the reality is its no big deal. I use an audio cable in the car because I prefer real speakers to any headphones or earbuds. The battery life is finally so good that with the supplied adapter you can listen longer than you will care to drive. Or do much of anything else. The home button. I find it annoying but maybe a little less than previous versions. I had devices without one first so they always seemed a bit old fashioned to me or like a step backwards. If you've always had one I guess its like replacing your favorite blanket or teddy bear with a slightly different one. Ultimately no big deal also. Except that adding water resistance is nice. As for the tech. Its awesome. Like as good as laptops were only a few years ago. As for the spec nuts. They forget perhaps the most important ones. I'll try to explain in a way more people get. Apple's software is like a sports car. Android like an SUV. So if the ""power"" specs don't seem so impressive it doesn't matter. You don't need as much to get better performance. Also maybe an even bigger consideration is data. If you have an unlimited plan or affordable one with a large amount premium phones are nice. If not or you use wifi or home internet more or only basic features or whatever get a cheaper phone that does what you use it for. The difference can buy a nice iPad or tablet of choice and possibly still have some left over. Again just personal preference. I travel a lot and carry a Bluetooth keyboard and adaptors to use hotel TVs as monitors so no need for extra devices. I've also done it the other way and carried around several including a laptop. Let me also say I'm not knocking Android. But on that front I would advise staying away from Samsung. Over rated cheap junk with a premium price. There are much nicer for the same or less money. I always liked the Sony or Moto products for build quality and actually being good at what you want to do. I switched to Apple and was aggravated at first. Still don't have a lot nice to say about the 6+ I had before this one. But seriously the 7 is a huge improvement. And maybe the least important personal reason, man the satin black is just nice! That's from an old gear head. The people who say it's not exciting well.... Its not. They're all little flat things you hold and touch to use. What it does and how well is more exciting than the next gimmick to me. Like edges that prevent using a useful case so the first time you drop it the wrong way you need to spend hundreds more on repairs or a replacement. Just great! Where do I not sign up?",0
4,A Nearly Perfect Phone,"September 22, 2017",0,"To all smart phone users looking for a device that has an operating system that is simplistic, yet powerful - the iPhone 7 is the phone for you...Upon purchasing iPhone 7, users will quickly realize that the technology that has been built into in this phone makes a noticeable impact on the overall user experience. The technology used makes everyday life easier, and allows the user to utilize their time more efficiently...Impactful Technology..â€¢ 12MP camera.â€¢ A10 Fusion chip.â€¢ Touch ID..These three features give the iPhone 7 the ability to improve the ease with which the user operates the phone. The 12MP camera is great for capturing all of lifeâ€™s most memorable events. The clarity and zoom capability of the camera gives the user the ability to pull out their phone and snap a photo, or take a video, in a matter of seconds. The speed at which you are able to open the camera and snap a picture can be directly related to the A10 Fusion chip that is inside the iPhone 7. This chip is the fastest processor that Apple has released, allowing the phone to operate at incredible speeds. The processor allows multitasking between various applications without any delays in output. Touch ID allows all the phones features to be accessible by simply scanning the users finger. This is a feature that is convenient and efficient...Missing Technology..â€¢ 3.5-mm stereo headphone jack..The absence of the 3.5-mm stereo headphone jack is the reason this phone is described as â€œnearly perfectâ€ù. In order to use headphones, they must be connected through the lightning port via a Lightning to 3.5-mm Headphone Adapter. The adapterâ€™s small size makes it easy to misplace. Apple left out this feature in order to make the phone thinner, but this makes the phone unable to charge while playing audio through headphones...The noticeable inconvenience of this problem, however, quickly fades within a few weeks, as keeping track of the adapter becomes easier. The user will also become more conscious about charging the phone when not using headphones...As you can see, this iPhone 7 has a long list of benefits and can make a big impact on the daily life of the user. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those looking for a phone that will make day to day life simpler and more efficient...",0

They also don't have that quality feel to them as do mac products. I went on line to check the serial number and it says that the 1 year warranty is over June 2018. Also the jack where the charger and headphones get plugged into is slightly dirty (not the new clean it should be). Overall, I'm not sure what else will fail since I probably got a refurbished phone. For now I'm stuck with no headphones.",1

They said yes, then several hours later when I got back my repaired apple I was asked to wait another 20 minutes, then approached and told Apple does not install third party equipment, but they could sell me a protector and install it - for 39 dollars.  I left in disgust..So far the list of apps recommended for Apple aren't available,  I can't import my music, and there's no such thing as an working app.  Siri sucks.  My bar strength has gone from four bars to two if I'm Lucky. Bleck!!!  Buy and Android!.",0

5,Love my new red phone,"November 30, 2017",1,Love my new red phone.  Red is one of favorite colors.  So i was so happy when apple came out with red one.  It functions just like advertised a. The dealer i purchased it through must have sent that same day because it arrived also immediately.,1
5,The best iPhone ever,"October 24, 2016",0,"The iPhone 7 (Plus) is by far the best iPhone ever created, possibly the best phone ever created. However, because it is similar to previous iPhones, I will try to focus on whats new and whats so great about it. First the processor, its amazing, but so is the processor in just about every phone now a days. But considering this phone is more powerful then any MacBook or MacBook Air, or Even iPad ever created, its pretty remarkable...Second, and this is probably the biggest, and greatest thing about this phone, is the camera, or should I say cameras. The iPhone 7 (Plus) hands down features the best camera on a phone I have ever seen. It is really fast to focus and to fire, and images are sharp and extremely color accurate. In fact, after putting this camera through its paces, I questioned why I even owned my Canon EOS 5D Mark III. But then I remembered, BOKEH. IOS 10.1 (which I beta tested) bring ""Portrait Mode"" which works, however not always. Also its not as good as a fast lens on my full-frame body, but there is definitely room to improve the portrait mode blurred effect. Overall this is a great camera...One of the last great things about this phone is the display. When I first placed my order, I wondered if the display would live up to the claims. Wider-color gamut, 25% brighter. Well it definitely does. This is honestly one of the most color accurate displays I have ever seen, and boy does it get bright when it needs to...Finally the added 256GB storage option is much appreciated, as I am a storage hog. Also I absolutely love the Jet Black color. this reminds of my first iPhone, the iPhone 3G. There are some negatives to this phone however, it definitely ""Hisses"" for one. However unless my phone is to the Apple Logo on the phone, I can not hear it. Also, the display is slightly (very slightly) more yellow then the iPhone 6s. However after using, I pulled out my iPhone 6s Plus, and though my iPhone 6s plus display was actually more yellow...If the small hiccups bother you, return it and get a new one, or go to the genus bar for a replacement. Other wise, sit back, and enjoy the best phone ever created...I ordered an iPhone 7 Plus 256GB Jet Black T-Mobile through Apples website at launch.",1

AppleCare and insurance is a necessity..Removing the headphone jack seems to have caused some major problems. It is a fragile little flower of a cell phone. Yes it might be waterproof, but that doesn't help if it does not work..I have been loyal apple user for years and yet within 30 days I am awaiting my second replacement iPhone 7 - on the first phone the charging port (and headphone port now) failed and actually pushed the cable out (ghost in the machine?). That was in the first week - it was replaced and the Second phone lasted 14 days before the same port failed completely. No headphones. No charging. No backing up!!

1,DO NOT BUY JET BLACK!,"November 2, 2016",0,"Put my jet black phone immediately in a case. Dust collects in the case from normal everyday use and that dust leaves marks all over the phone.

5,The Pinnacle of the iPhone Experience,"October 4, 2016",0,"Design..This is the best looking iPhone yet in my mind. First off the antenna lines on the rear of the phone are moved more to the top and bottom of the phone and blend in more than they did on the iPhone 6/6S. Even better, if you have the black or jet black versions, they donâ€™t really show up at all. Overall, it looks similar to the 6/6S, but feels like the final, evolved version of the design. The size feels great and overall, it is just a beautiful phone...As stated above, the iPhone 7 has added both black and jet black colors. They havenâ€™t utilized a true black color since the iPhone 4/4S, and these new colors truly look so much better than the space gray of old. Also as mentioned, they almost completely hide the antenna lines which is a huge plus. My personal pick would be the jet black, but the regular black looks much better in real life than it does on the Apple website where it looks more gray than it truly is. You can also still get the phone in gold, silver, and rose gold variations...The home button is now not an actual â€œbutton,â€ù but utilizes the 3D touch like capability to simulate the idea you are pressing a button. The settings options gives three different modes to simulate this, and after only a day, I completely got used to it. The fingerprint sensor is as fast as ever which makes unlocking your phone a consistent and seamless experience. I have faced very few occasions where my fingerprint didn't accurately register...The iPhone series has officially become waterproof! By doing this, it makes me feel so much more secure in just the day to day tasks of using my phone. If Iâ€™m caught in a rainstorm, it is reassuring to not have to tuck the phone and run like a football player. It is also dustproof and is rated IP67 which means it is certified to be resistant for up to three feet for thirty minutes...Camera..The rear camera is stronger than ever on the iPhone 7. It has an improved 12MP camera that takes excellent pictures. The regular version of the iPhone finally has OIS (optical image stabilization) just like its big brothers, the Plus series. The pictures it takes are clear, capture a great amount of light, and due to the OIS, rarely come out blurry. The camera loads lightning fast and is overall just a spectacular camera...The front camera also took another bump up to 7MP. The combination of the improved resolution, consistent retina flash (front flash), and speed are excellent on the front camera. I still wish it had a wider field of vision, but other than that, I have no complaints about the front camera...Display..The Retina display is the same as it has been since the iPhone 4. 326 pixels per inch is a good looking display. It certainly does not compete with some other phones and their higher resolution screens, but for now, the screen still gets the job done. I would like to see them improve this in the next installment, but it is still a pleasing screen to view at 4.7 inches...The brightness is outstanding and it also drops very low too, which is a benefit if you are trying to read something in a dark room. According to Apple the brightness is better than ever, but I have not noticed any discernible difference in that area...Audio..The audio is excellent. It finally has stereo speakers where sound comes out the bottom right speaker grill and the top speaker on the front of the screen. Having stereo speakers, along with a front facing one makes such a difference when listening to music or watching a video. It sounds great and just makes the listening experience so much more enjoyable.  This is certainly one of the biggest improvement areas over last year. Also, in terms of the big headphone jack controversy, it does actually come with a lightning to 3.5mm converter, so you can still use headphones with it...Battery..Battery life has improved over the 6S and SE. On daily use, I have gotten a couple more hours of use per day. I would still welcome faster charging options, but this is a nice step up from previous generations. It has increased to 1,960 mAh battery which makes a difference...Functionality..This is the pinnacle of the IOS software experience. The 2GB of RAM, the A10 processor, and the implementation of IOS 10 is great. Everything runs well and quickly. Also, the fact that the storage sizes have all doubled to 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB is fantastic, as 16GB is a very antiquated notion. Expandable storage would be welcome, but due to how IOS is more locked down and for monetary reasons, I understand why that wonâ€™t most likely be a feature in the near future...The software is clean, smooth, and works well. There are still a few pet peeves such as not being able to close all the apps down at once or not being able to make simple changes such as changing the color of text messages instead of just grey, blue, and green without jailbreaking the phone. But that is also part of its strength. Everything on the phone has been glossed to a high sheen, and almost everything runs well. IOS is simple, straightforward, and I look at it like a menu at a restaurant: it may not have the largest selection or allow you to ask for substitutions, but what you did get is mostly excellent...If you would like to read more of my reviews, please check out: smartphonehaven.com",1

3,"Great except for missing headphone jack,","March 19, 2017",0,"I upgraded to the iPhone 7 and have to say that most of my experience has been good. The larger size was a change but after a few weeks I really like that. The one main complaint is the removal of the headphone jack. My home stereo system has a connection, but is not blue tooth enabled, which means I either no longer listen to my music on my home entertainment system, or I now have to buy a new stereo, plus now my earphones are basically worthless. Plus my truck isn't enabled either, so now I just listen on the phone. The jury is still out as to whether I'm going to downgrade, as the other features are nice, if not for the headphone jack change it would have been a 5 star. If you only have blue tooth devices to connect to, go ahead and upgrade.",0

1,No headphone jack?  Fail.,"April 12, 2017",0,"I've had Apple iPhone's for years, and I only own Apple computers and iPads, but I hate this iPhone7 so much I think I'll try turning it back in and getting an iPhone 6.  This is my problem: I teach fitness classes at a dozen different gyms all with different sound systems, and because the iPhone doesn't have a headphone jack, I can no longer connect to their sound system.  Yes, the iPhone came with an adapter, but that 2 inch adapter was quickly lost with all the running around that I do.  SO, I bought a dozen inexpensive adapters from China to have plenty of extras on hand (about $1 each as opposed to the Apple price of $9) but when I plug them in, they work for about 10 seconds, then they stop working with a message on my iPhone that says something like, ""This accessory is not supported.""  This whole situation has become an expensive, inconvenient mess for me.  It seems that with the new iPhone, I cannot easily charge and listen to my headphones at the same time, and that if I lose my headphone adapter I'm forced to buy the expensive iPhone brands.  Someone told me that they got rid of the headphone jacks so that people would be forced to by the blue tooth ear buds.  Apple!  This is a disaster for me, and it really does appear that you engineered this inconvenience just to sell more accessories.  How about thinking about what would be most convenient for your customers, who are paying $800 for an iPhone?",2

1,Generalized 7 Review,"May 19, 2017",0,"I have owned strictly androids, until I was forced into an iPhone for work. I have had a 5, 6s plus, and now, the 7. When I got so mad at the poor functionality of the 6, and after smashing and breaking it, i got the 7, thinking it was a superior phone. Well, compared even to the 6, and the horrible LG line up that they've had their entire time as a smart phone manufacturer, the 7 is literally a pile of garbage...Here is what is right with it:.- The camera. It works. The 6 was better...That's it. Here's what's wrong with it:.- Freezes randomly in the middle of a task.- Randomly closes me out of apps.- Not smooth, fluid functionality.- Voice to text is laughably worse than Android. Before the latest iOS update, that was one of the only things I preferred about the iPhone over an Android. Now, apple has nothing..- Maps is a joke.- The home button is also a joke. In order to do a reset, you have to hold the power and volume down key, which in turn turns your volume down. Because that couldn't be programmed to operate differently..- Who needs a headphone jack? Not the 7, apparently. Now you have to buy a separate $25 piece to listen to music..- Overall cheap feel..- Autocorrect. What? You typed ""of""? You obviously meant ""if""...I could go on and on about how terrible this phone is. But, I think you get it. I have put in a request at work to get back into a 6, because of how terrible this phone is. Out of the nearly two dozen phones I've owned over my lifetime, this stands at my number one spot for worst phone available to major providers over the last 15 years. I have also been to the three major providers (Tmobile, att, and Verizon), and have had a huge array of different kinds of phones. I say with confidence, that this is the worst phone I have ever had the stress, and displeasure of using...Buy at your own risk. These phones are terrible.",3

1,NOT FOR AUDIO PHILES,"April 20, 2017",0,"The fact that I have to use one an adapter just to use normal headphone is so stupid it makes my eyes bleed. I really used to love apple, but this whole ""taking out the audio jack"" thing is the dumbest move they have ever made. The original adapter that came with my iPhone 7 crapped out after only a couple months. So now I have to buy another one (and I'm assuming yet another one after this one breaks) when they should have just kept the audio jack in the first place...Also if you go anywhere and want to plug in your phone without using bluetooth, you have to carry around an adapter with you...WTF? Bluetooth can be a pain in the ass and not every sound system has it. Wireless headphones are garbage especially for any type of vigorous exercise...That's not even the worst part...not being able to charge the phone while having music playing is mind boggling annoying. Especially since I'm a musician and use a lot of music apps, this just adds to my frustration and difficulties when syncing midi devices and performing. You can get more adapters for these things but that just leads to a weird tangle of wires all of which are prone to failure...If you give a crap about audio, seriously reconsider buying an iPhone 7. And these adapters straight up suck..",0

It did this repeatedly for about six months...After about six months, it stopped erasing my whole library, but instead, the titles of songs were replaced with random numbers...About a month ago, my phone started randomly shutting off or restarting.

1,This phone is NOT waterproof nor water resistant. Best of luck if it's splashed as well,"April 24, 2017",0,"This phone is NOT waterproof nor water resistant and I would be very hesitant to say, like every other iphone model, itâ€™s not splash resistant either. There is also nothing the iphone employees can do, while they are polite, the consensus felt like, we are Apple and while we advertise the phone is splash and water resistant if you get water near this phone tough luck, we are the trendy, hip phone and people will keep buying us..My experience: I purchased the new iPhone 7 while traveling as it advertised a better camera and as long as I was careful it would do well against water as I was in SE Asia and humidity was an issue with my iPhone 6. I had the phone for 3 weeks, put it in my dry bag after taking some photos, pulled it out and it never turned on again. My bag was dry on the inside, the phone had no visible splashes or water on it. It was hot and I had no idea what was wrong with it as it had no water on it or in the bag. I found out later it somehow got water inside I can only imagine from humidity which is only an issue Iâ€™ve had with Apple products, now twice..I was in the Philippines at the time and took the phone to the local iservice store in Cebu. They told me there was nothing I could do and to call the customer hotline. Since my phone was broken I had to borrow the phone at a pizza restaurant. It was midafternoon on a Monday, I mention this because it took approximately 1.5-2 hours on hold prior to talking with a customer agent. She said there was nothing I could do since I was not in the country the phone was made (US) and basically, I needed to get to a western country to have it serviced. Since I needed a phone while I was traveling I requested to escalate the issue, I was passed on to another higher agent that again said there is nothing I can do after 2 more hours on hold..For three months I held on to the phone hoping I would get better service once I arrived home or in Europe where I would be staying indefinitely. In Europe they took the phone apart and concluded it had water damage. Now I understand there is no way Apple can know what happen and after insisting to 3 employees and a manager that there was no water damage I was told there is nothing that can be done with the warranty and that I could replace the phone for ~400 Euros. They mentioned it had corrosion, which made sense since it somehow got water inside, while in a dry bag and I had to spend the next three months trying to find an iPhone storeâ€_.Moving forward I will purchase Samsung products. In my experience iPhones are overpriced, overhyped, made out of glass and have years of testing to go before they advertise as water or splash resistant. Unfortunately the service is also poor because theyâ€™ve built such a strong brand. Hopefully there is somewhere I can donate a $800 three week old piece of garbage....",0

Size is just right for me - the iPhone plus is too big. So is the Note 7..- iMessages is fun and fast.- Siri is better with the faster chip..Camera is better, of course.

I have the iPad PRO: love the pen...Recommendation :  get the 128 gbyte version or the next level up...",13
4,A nice phone overall,"October 15, 2016",0,"The iPhone7 is a very nice phone overall. Most of all, it got better speakers from the iPhone6s, thanks to the missing headphone; however, when charging the battery, we can't listen to music, which could be disadvantageous. As for the battery, iPhone 7 features 14% larger battery compared to iPhone 6, but the battery dropped 40% when all I do is listen to music for an hour, which I think could be because the engine fast and quick, so it affects the battery life. Regarding the camera, the quality is amazing, and it's 1.5 times clearer and the zoom is better than before. As for the sensitivity of the screen, I felt inconvenient when I swipe left or right because the screen didn't move sometimes. Especially, when I used iCloud Drive, the screen was stuck in the iCloud Drive a few times, so this is nonsense for one of the greatest smart phones. Most of all, I like the 3D touch action, and the solid-state homebutten. Therefore, on a scale of 1-4. I'll give 4 stars because I think they just have to work on the sensitivity of the screen and battery life; however, I like the design, a nice camera, a fast engine, and the 3D touch action.",1
5,Finally a phone that works,"October 31, 2016",0,"A long story but I ended up with a Jet Black 256Gb iPhone 7, after a poor experience with my much loved HTC 10 and HTC Suppor..The iPhone 7 is just a awesome phone; where the heck have I been for last few years. I could not believe how simple it was transfering 17,000+ mp3's and 1000's of photos. All (or most all) apps that I have used for years were available via iTunes Store. This phone is something to behold. I blows the HTC 10 out of the water and I was a HTC fan boy...I hate saying it, but Apple are in a class of their own and did I mention that the battery life is awesome. The camera is awesome and I love the fact that Google Earth, MAPS and Drive work flawlessly; as does Microsoft 365...This phone is worth every cent I spent and then some..",1

1,Not Recommended,"January 17, 2017",0,"iPhone 7 is the equivalent of Windows 10: Overhyped, but not an improvement. I've lost good apps and no longer get sounds when I am texted. The ONLY benefit was that my employer paid for it, but if I had a choice I would turn it in now and get my 6s back.",0
2,Losing love from early adopters ...,"October 1, 2016",0,"I have owned an iPhone 3G, two iPhone 4, one 4S and three iPhone 6s. We also had iPads (from iPad 2 to Air 2). I am quite dissapointed with Apple's recent changes both to iOS and the product lines...The iPhone's ORIGINAL most important feature was that it could host you music. I use my phone for calls almost the entire day. I listen to music and take calls in mu phone and comouter all the time...This means bluetooth is not good. I don't need the radiation, the constant recharging baby sitting, and the cumbersome dongle to charge the phone while using a wired headset. I also have a car without bluetooth, that has an rj plug. The best quality is using the jack. This is a high end stereo speaker, and I have tried bluetooth adapters, and it sounds really awful...My famility has had to replace broken glasses so many times too. The more they make it fancy, the easiest to get them to crack. Since everything is getting integrated, a glass crack means replacing a very expensive screen now (this started with 6S line)...I will skip iPhone 7, and have already had my wife tell me she doesn't want it either...I can't rate this phone more than 2 stars. The iPhone 6S gets 3 (due to the screen), the 4S would get 5 (but it's too slow now) and this last phone gets a 2: a hassle to me, overpriced, and requires extra insurance (screen) while being to fragile and thin making the battery small so it can't last me a single day, making the thin phone turn into clumsy one that needs a case...Apple can build products, and make decisions. I can skip those products. But when you make an ecosystem, where switching is very hard, and start taking away choices without consulting, you are abusing your user base...Is this a bad phone? No. But it's much worst than 6S to me, and its predecessors. And compared to them, it's a 3, and one star is taking by the horrendous cross sell that is happening in the AppStore (i don't care one bit iPhone App has an iWatch App, stop telling me: you already know I have no iEatch registered with you). They are also responsible for bringing casinos into into childs lives and those that can't refrain, through the In App purchase model. I am discouting 1 star for that, and retroactively to all other phones as well...The iPhone is still my prefered choice. But I am odds with how its features are evolving in ways that I don't like, and make it an inferior product overall...",10

Overall, great phone and I think I'll be sticking around with iPhone for awhile.",0
4,iPhone 7 review,"September 23, 2016",0,"iPhone 7.Each year, Apple Inc. launches a better version of the iPhone into the market. I agree, the iPhone 7 is the highest preforming smartphone in the market to date. The A10 Fusion chip, whose function is to power the iPhone 7, is comprised of four distinct cores: two low-energy cores designed for easier tasks while ensuring low power usage and two high-performance cores to handle the most intense tasks. When testing my iPhone 7, I noticed that it had an internal storage of 128GB and the speed of some personal computers. The phone is ideal for university students who are always on the go and store everything on their phones. This is a pretty big deal since one of the biggest issues with the iPhone's was storage..Design.The iPhone 7 has an elegant new design that comes in five finishes, silver, gold, rose gold, black, and jet black. The black finish is characterized by an anodized matte look.  The jet black finish is consummated through anodization and innovative polish, perfecting its glossy finish. An exclusively and perfectly reengineered enclosure makes the phone water resistant while offering maximum protection against dust, spills, or even splashes..Screen.The iPhone 7 screen is more improved as compared to iPhone 6s, which makes it comfortable for the user even in the harsh midday glare. For instance, I can comfortably read an article in the sunlight using my phone. Also, the screen is capable of supporting a wider gamut of color, making videos, as well as photos to pop with saturated and vivacious hue..Apps.Launching Apps on the iPhone 7 is quicker than other Smartphones. Its processor works very fast and is capable of running high graphic games and supporting convoluted photo-editing applications. The iPhone's battery is capable of lasting longer than a day when used normally..Camera.The iPhone 7 is built with a single 12-megapixel iSight camera whose performance is incomparable to that of the iPhone 6s. The aperture lens of this phone is wider, f1.8, allowing penetration of more light, making it possible to take better photos in the dark or low-light. The iPhone 7 is comprised of an optical image stabilizer that was initially limited to only superior Plus Smartphone models.  Also, the phone has a TrueTone flash which is brighter when compared to that of iPhone 6s. The color of the photos is remarkable on the iPhone 7 due to the P3 color gamut. Its distinctive features, such as the iOS 10 can allow a third-party application to effectively access RAW data from its iSight camera. All these features put the iPhone 7 at the top of the list when it comes to smartphones..",12

Each phone's ringtone and any clicking sound stop working after about 2 years of use. No damage caused by me at all. When I called Apple they said it's out of warranty and it would cost about $300 to replace or repair the phone. This happened for both iphone. I read the book Steve Jobs and I realized Apple's strategy is to integrate everything and hard to repair them. I think they don't care about customer's burden for repair. I am definitely switching to Galaxy for my next smart phone. Strongly recommend not to use iphone.,0
5,They made a lot of incremental changes that adds up in end,"September 22, 2016",0,"After a long wait the Iphone 7 is now here. Thanks Samsung for messing up the note 7 launch. I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device. Over 2.5 million devices have been recalled and multiple lawsuits claiming negligence on Samsungâ€™s part has been filed for damages. So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot.

Apple has added a few features to the phone such as the vibrating home button, a better camera with 14 mega pixels for the back and 7 mega pixels for the front. With not much change in the phone design but a few, apple stepped up with the software up date adding new texting feature and just giving the phone a new look software wise. But honestly when it comes down to it, the 7 is similar to the 6 in multiple ways and this makes me wish that apple would of done a better job at redesigning the new iPhone. I would recommend apple to anyone due to the dependability of their phones but keep in mind that with new releases of this phone might bring some disappointment.",0

5,2 review in life,"May 8, 2017",1,This is the second review I write and honestly I just take the time to do it because I feel I have spent my moeny very well in this iphone 7. So I just crashed my iphone7 I bought in november 2016 and apparently Im still eligible for apple care and stuff the serial number is verified in the apple webpage and stuff.. To be honest in previous purchases I've been scammed here in amazon since blackberry were the boom.. I have nothing bad to say about the iphone because its so loke the other iphones like works really good and the signal ls good.,0

5,"Brilliant for New users , but nothing special for iphone 6/6 plus owners","September 22, 2016",0,"I ordered this phone from official Apple store..Let me tell you my story, i was android dude and i kinda hated Iphone , you know why ? because people keep buying them not because of needs but for being more fashionable or being popular among the friends or general community..I upgraded my phone from samsung galaxy s5 and i had a choice :.1. Samung galaxy s7.2. Iphone 7.I checked every forum on the internet and it was really hard for me to make this decision really . Mostly i appreciate phones specifications and the only thing in which samsung was better was the screen resolution ( i dont really need 2k display -_-) and camera which needs some kind of knowledge to take good pictures but iphone is more like easier..I did not buy iphone 7 plus because it is far too big for me and my pocket ..I like phone itself but ios system is not comfortable for me , because android has way too much freedom , but i won't write less than 5 stars because of my tastes about ios system..PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY GOT IPHONE 6 or 6 PLUS IF YOU REALLY BUY PHONE FOR ITS SPECIFICATIONS OR FEATURES DON't UPGRADE , I HAD A LOT OF TIME WITH IPHONE 6 AND THERE IS WAY TOO SMALL AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCES...PERSONALLY I THINK THAT NOBODY SHOULD UPGRADE PHONE EVERY YEAR OR 2 TIMES PER YEAR. AIN'T NO COMPANY UPGRADES THEIR GADGETS 1-2 TIMES PER YEAR SO THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY NEED UPGRADE SINCE PREVIOUS VERSION OF IT. WAIT 1-2 YEAR AND THEN GO UPGRADE..UPDATE ###1 : i get used to it, phone works perfectly and seems very fast. I like it and maybe i won't change it :).....",6

Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note...- Better display (wider colour gamut).- Better taptic engine.- 5 grams lighter.- IP67 Water and dust resistance.- Way better A10 Fusion CPU.- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p).- Rear camera have OIS.- Better low light performance.- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE.- Slightly better battery life.- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)..The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note. Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!...",5
