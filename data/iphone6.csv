1.0,"Brand New Only Outside, Fraud.","May 8, 2017",1,"I've bought this Iphone as an brand new Apple. It comes looking like a brand new product. From the box to the device appearence, the charger and the headphones, But it has been not been an ""Apple"" experience at all. I've had five Iphone before. Whith less than six months of light use, it started to seriously bug. I took it to an authorized premiun Apple technical assistance and just find out the phone was not original inside. Apple cant even help me. They cant even fix it.The screen is not original and many other itens are from used phones. I do immediately request a position from the Amazon and from the seller. This is seriuos fraud. Wait for your asnwer as soon as possible, before i take other providences. Joao 08/05/2017.",261

4.0,An Android User's Review of the iPhone 6: Read this if you are thinking of switching from Android!!!,"January 28, 2015",0,"So I made the switch from using Android to the iPhone back in October, and I've been using the iPhone 6 for the past few months now and can give a detailed review on what it's like to switch over.  Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4.  Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on.  Here are my thoughts:..Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):.1. Camera.  The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone.  Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone.  This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone.  (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user.  Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review)...2.  Reliability.  There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices.  On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else.  Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use...3. Fingerprint sensor.  Once you've used it, you won't go back.  The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor.  The one in the iPhone 6 works really well.  I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps...4. Control of apps.  This is an interesting point.  In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS.  But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera.  In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access...5.  Double tap to bring down the row of apps.  I can't believe no one has thought of this before.  A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that.  You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use...Here are the things that I miss on Android:.1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps.  I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that.  I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there)...2. Better email.  In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone.  You can't do that on Apple.  You can't even attach a single file.  You have to share a file as an email.  So, forget about replying an email with an attachment.  This is pretty annoying...3. Productivity is better on Android.  If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app).  You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected.  It's so seamless.  Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines).  So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app.  It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data...4. Notifications are way better.  Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications?  You have to individually close each app's own notification.  I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched...5.  Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri.  Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one.  More customization and etc...Conclusion:.Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one.  The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg.  I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for.  So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios:..If you are user type.....Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone.  The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices.  I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X.  Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow.  One Plus One is actually pretty cool.  They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse...Medical and Science community: iPhone.  Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS...Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun:  iPhone.  The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone...For older folks: This is a split.  If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn.  Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective.  It is more intuitive than it used to be...Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera.  Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use.  I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves...So was this the right switch for me?  As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android.  While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone.  Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it...Another side note:  Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS).  And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well.  I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it.  So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box.  The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone...Summary and TL; DR:.So there you have it.  An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6.  Do I have regrets switching over?  After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it.  But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points.  If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching...Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android.  However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity.  If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone.  There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS.  It really does come down to personal preference...***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above.  It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails.  You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins.  Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great!  You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox!  And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file.  Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps).  This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise).  ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5.  There are still kinks when switching over if you are used to productive flexibility on Android phones, but right now the 3rd party apps are getting better and better at work-arounds...***UPDATE 1/2/2017:  The iPhone 6 has served me well over the past two years, but I've made the upgrade to the iPhone 7 a few months ago.  If you are interested in reading about my thoughts on the iPhone 7, you can read my review here on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/review/R1WITRNVJL6ALR/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm......","1,204"

1.0,An Unbelievable Scam,"February 2, 2018",1,"After only seven months of buying this phone it completely goes out on me.  Totally dead.  I had to take it today to some far away Apple Store to have it properly diagnosed and fixed, praying it was just a battery issue.  It was a hardware issue.  This ""new iPhone""  of seven months, according to the Apple employee, is actually three years old, and had been previously purchased by someone else through a Verizon store.  And it had been opened and repaired too.  I can't believe Amazon sells such a scam to its customers.  I want to be fully reimbursed for this product.  Buyers, beware.",3

Sometimes  it would say (for example) 70% battery and a few minutes later it would say 35%, then plug it in and immediately it would again show 70%...The seller of this certified reconditioned phone is trying hard to market iPhones at a reasonable price.  Dealfisher is ready to refund and gave me an extra credit for my trouble.I did purchase another iPhone from Dealfisher which I finally got to work. It also had a 4G LTE problem. Looked at the internet and found an answer that worked. Buy a another SIM card and turn cellular data on and off three times. Bingo!...",2

(but some drawbacks still exists, namely not to be able to directly transfer e.g. MP3 files to it... I use the work around via Amazon music which also lets you download your own music on to the device, via cloud service.... it is a bit more complicated but ultimately it works)....",2

1.0,EBWireless has terrible customer service.,"July 17, 2017",1,"EBWireless has terrible customer service...We purchased an iPhone in December 2016, but it began having battery issues about 4-5 months later. We figured it was a problem with app usage or something software related. However, after trying several methods, such as closing open apps, deleting facebook, etc. the battery problems persisted. The battery issue got so bad that the phone would shut down within a few minutes if it was not plugged in. It essentially turned into a corded home telephone...The description of the product stated the phone had been thoroughly tested and inspected and was determined to be ""100% fully functional"" as determined by their ""experts.""  Given that representation, I felt I would be in good standing in returning the phone because it obviously had a defect which rendered it nearly worthless. We did not pay $430 to rent a cell phone for 5 months, which then turns into a corded telephone indefinitely...When I contacted EBWireless about the issue, I received a one line email response: ""Your item is out of warranty."" Nothing else. No greeting. No contact information. Not even a name. When I followed up to insist, here is the response I received via e-mail:..""We do not sell defective phones, you used the phone for over 7 months. Warranty by Amazon's return policy is 30 days but sometimes we give exceptions. Also this item was fulfilled by Amazon not by us, we can not help you.""..Nice...Anyway, I was able to get a full refund from Amazon, so that's nice. Now we need to buy a new phone.....",2

Today, May 23rd/17, the home button stopped working all of the sudden. I take very good care of my things and it has always had screen and case cover on. This is either a disposable phone or this company is selling the phones Apple says they are not good after 30 days... being that the time limit for their ""warranty"". I've learnt my lesson: buy it at a place that is willing to offer 1 year warranty.",1
1.0,Battery was corrupted,"February 26, 2018",1,"When I got the phone I immediately charged it up. It charged to 100% and then I began to use it. The battery only lasted less than an hour and it died at 54%. At first I thought the app I was using crashed the phone. Eventually, I realized it was the battery when the phone progressively died with less and less battery usage. Eventually it got to the point where it would die if I took it off of a charger. I tried solving my problem by buying another phone from this seller. Of course that phone had problems too. It was unable to connect to anything. It couldn't read my sims card or connect to the wifi. I sent that one back but I kept the original phone. I was undergoing a real time crunch. I was about to go away on a trip and needed a working phone. I finally decided to take it into the Apple Store to see if there was anything they could do. Returning this phone would have been even more of a hassle and like I said, I needed a phone for my trip. The Apple Store ran a diagnostic test and confirmed that the battery was completely non-functual. They said they could quickly replace the battery with a new one for $80. When I bought the phone I thought it had a warranty, but of course, since I didn't buy the phone DIRECTLY from Apple, it had zero warranty with them...I wouldn't buy a phone from this seller. Just spend the extra money and get your phone directly from Apple. You will save yourself time and the hassle. You might even save yourself some money...",0

It had many false parts, and there were a lot of stickers in Chinese inside the phone!! There were pieces missing, and the piece that makes the phone vibrate had 2 screws loose. He stated that there were so many pieces (including the screen) that were NOT Apple, that there was absolutely nothing that could be done through the Apple Store!..Now, this phone - as it states on the receipt received after the purchase - was ""Apple iPhone 6 16 GB Factory Unlocked -.BRAND NEW - SEALED !!!"".

5.0,Apple did a great job with this phone,"August 22, 2016",1,"Apple did a great job with this phone.  I bought this to replace my girlfriend's Galaxy S5, and she couldn't be happier!  The phone arrived quickly (Prime same-day), I cut my girlfriend's micro-SIM down to a nano-SIM (carefully) and popped it in, added her Google account with all of her email and contacts, and she was up and running, all within about 15 minutes!..I use an iPhone SE for work, and a Galaxy S6 Edge the rest of the time.  The iPhone 6 is only slightly smaller and lighter than my S6, but it feels much thinner, much lighter, and is so much more comfortable to hold.  The S6 has a larger screen, and WAY more pixels, but the screen on the iPhone 6 looks way better to me.  Just like my iPhone SE, the iPhone 6 lasts all day on a single charge (unless you're playing Pokemon Go), and when the battery finally runs down, it charges back up in no time...Switching between WiFi and 4G (like when leaving my house in the morning) is so much smoother than with my S6.  With the S6, if I'm outside, with poor WiFi signal, I have to turn WiFi off to force the 4G connection, where the iPhone is completely seamless...I switched from iOS to Android after Apple stopped innovating (iPhone 4, 4S, 5, ...), switched from Samsung when they did the same (Galaxy S3, S4, S5), then from HTC when they also followed suit (HTC One M7, M8, M9).  I've been super happy with my S6 Edge for the past year, but I like the iPhone 6 so much, it might be time to make a move back to Apple for my primary, and order one of these for myself!..The only complaint I have is the short, cheap lightning cable Apple ships with their phones.  I ordered some of the 6 ft. Amazon Basics cables (Apple Certified), and I'm expecting them to last at least twice as long as the Apple cable...Other thoughts: 16 GB?!  That leaves less than 10 GB usable after the space required for the OS.  Geez Apple, memory is so cheap!  Add more storage to your entry models or give me a micro-SD slot......",4

1.0,Looking for a solution,"February 6, 2017",1,"I bought this phone on January 2, It arrived 3-4 weeks later (as everything I order from amazon, I am in Honduras). As I received it the headphone jack was not working, when I plugged in the headphones the sound was very bad quality, I am not even able to enjoy a song (which is really important to me), but the sound that comes out of the iphone is good quality, just not able to listen through the headphone jack. The phone has always been in a lifeproof phone case, it has never been drop, I have not submerged into water and it is new. I was going to let go of the sound problem even though I was dissappointed; but on saturday the touch started giving me problems. Yesterday (sunday) I was not able to use my phone at all  even though I restarted the phone several times to see if that would help, but it did not; even if it did work it would not last for more than 15 seconds. I left the phone alone for the rest of the day and today I turned it on, the touch works when it wants to (and if it does, it just last for some minutes if lucky) and stops whenever it decides. Right now I am not beeing able to use it..I got to the conclusion that the phone came with failures and maybe it is just  my bad luck and the rest of the phones came out good but I really would like to know if there is something I could do about it because honestly I do really need it, and in this condition it is just a waste of money. Please contact me if you think I could send the phone back and get another that works properly..Thanks and bye!..",20

Because of the audio issue, the phone is unable to record voice messages or shoot videos with any audio recorded. Additionally, the iPhone 6 has also shut down on its own several times without any prompting. You can imagine my frustration when I'm unable to hear or speak to my friends, family and business associates...I've tried to reboot/restart the iPhone a few times. I've also reset and restored the phone and it doesn't seem to remedy the situation.",5

I put my SIM card in, called the number on my SIM activation kit, and was ready to go within 5 minutes! No additional effort was required on my part. Having iCloud made restoring all of my settings a breeze, and, if my phone ever breaks, I won't lose any data since iCloud makes a backup every time the phone is plugged in and connected to wifi!

I have not charged it since, besides listening to music through USB in my car when driving, and it's been almost a week...The build of this phone is beautiful.

I ignored a lot of the other 1 star reviews when I bought this, and turns out they were right...The phone I received was a Japanese model, and everything works perfectly fine on it...except the shutter sound is impossible to disable. I even took it to an Apple store to get the firmware replaced with a U.S. version and that didn't fix the problem either.  Also note that Apple will not replace your phone for you if you buy this phone; they will only give you a replacement if you bought a U.S. version. I have to return the phone now and I'm pretty pissed off...EDIT: I just got off the phone with Apple support. Apparently not only will they not replace the phone for you, they will NOT SERVICE THE PHONE whatsoever in the U.S. either. So if you bring this into the apple store within your 1 year manufacturer's warranty period because of some hardware or software issue, then you will NOT be able to get any assistance with the phone because it is a Japanese model...I am incredibly pissed off that none of this was disclosed to me when I purchased the phone.....",23
