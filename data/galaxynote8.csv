5.0,I simply put my AT&amp;T; SIM card from other phone and it works just fine It is Dual SIM slot so you can play ...,"September 29, 2017",1,"I believe this model is for Europe so it comes with 220 voltage cable charger. At least mine did..Therefore, you need 110v charging cable or wireless charger if you are considering this in US..But given this age, I'm sure people have lots of 110v chargers lying around...I simply put my AT&amp;T; SIM card from other phone and it works just fine.It is Dual SIM slot so you can play it with either two SIM cards or one SIM and a SD card...Battery life is decent. I talk to other people quite a bit, occasional youtube and surfing internet on daily basis and battery lasts good for me..I had S7 edge with 3,600 mAh before and surprisingly, I feel both have similar battery life, so no complaining for me..I assume that software optimization works well as Samsung presents..But if battery life is still your main concern, then simply put battery saving mode, and you will be fine since there isn't much of performance loss from it...S pen is certainly a nice thing to play with. I can draw, write things on the phone. Personally, it helps me a lot for my new work environment...I don't use Bixby much but voice commands seem to work accurately..I don't have a big hand, but location of its button doesn't bother me that much...I don't use finger print unlock thingy at all so no comments on that..Iris scan feature works well too, if you are interested. But I use pattern unlock most of time...This supposedly great dual camera works fine. Quality of pictures are certainly nice and sharp. But because photography is my acutal/serious hobby, I use DSLR a lot. So this dual camera isn't that attractive to me. Don't get me wrong though, it will serve you great for sure. I bought this phone for S pen, not camera...As many of you know it by now, screen display of this phone is phenomenal. It's beautiful and sucks you right in...I don't know much about sound quality because I use bluetooth earbuds and android auto most of the time. Speaker of the phone itself sounds decent enough but for sure there are better phones for this matter..But it's not game changer for me...I can't compare its overall with equivalent products from Apple or any other brand for that matter, because I've used Samsung phones only since beginning of the time. (being Korean does that easily for you)..To sum up, for people with experiences of Samsung products,.If you want the cool, latest, flagship phone of the time even if S pen is for decoration only and wallet is thick enough, then it's for you..If you want cool, latest, flagship of the time and okay with spending quite sum but not this much and S pen isn't interesting, then S8/S8+ is for you..If you use/will use S pen extensively, and/or seeking upgrade from Note 4, 5 and 7(FE), then it's for you. (Don't forget trade-in deals).If you know that you want this specific phone for sure but don't want pay this much whatsoever and have a patience, then wait til next spring/summer when S9 comes out. (Not an official, but for sure there will be one).If you are okay with wife yelling at you for paying this much on a single phone, then it's for you (totally not personal experience, just saying)..These are my personal opinion, yours will be vary.",59
5.0,Fantastic device,"January 26, 2018",1,"I had the Note 3 for exactly 4 years. I also bought but never much used the Nokia Lumia 1020 (better camera but lousy OS)...I loved my Note 3 and used it all the time for camera, web searches, MANY audio books, some note-taking and so on. Even used it for a phone!..Now that I have the Note 8, the old Note 3 seems suddenly so old and slow and clunky...I studied reviews of ALL the ""flagship"" phones including the iPhone X (overpriced). I kept thinking I PROBABLY really wanted the S-pen (MUCH improved since Note 3) but still spent many, many hours looking at other options...Finally I decided I did want the pen feature and so Samsung's monopoly won the day...Nothing about the 8 disappoints. It is a fantastic phone and super smooth and fast and elegant and excellent, comparable to or surpassing similarly priced phones, in almost every way...The ONLY problem I have is the sealed in, non-removable battery. But nobody sells a removable battery anymore. Sigh...By the way I use the S-pen (like right now) all the time. It's uses and functionlity are awesome...All-in-all, Samsung has gotten pretty much everything right, I'd say. The amount of design and tech in this thing is utterly awesome. No bloat, smooth ease of use, power!..I guess I love this thing..",5
5.0,Great phone! Got it from Wireless Place and phone ...,"October 12, 2017",1,"Great phone! Got it from Wireless Place and phone came brand new and factory sealed. Model number is SM-N950F/DS. No ""Samsung Note8"" logo or ""DUOS"" logo on the rear, just a clean and solid ""SAMSUNG"" logo. I am pleased with the seller and so far so good with the phone.",11
4.0,Great phone and seller(NGP STORE USA),"December 16, 2017",1,Great phone and seller(NGP STORE USA). This order arrived one business day early but then I am just down the coast. Everything was factory sealed and brand new. This Note8 runs 4G like the one I got from T-mobile. No complaints...P.S. The phone came with a clear case in the box for free! I thought it was just a tray to hold the papers. American version of the phone didn't come with a case clear or otherwise.....Will do business with NGP STORE USA again. Highly recommended..,7
5.0,The best note,"October 5, 2017",1,I must say that I have been a user of the range note from the number 1 I have had all including the 7 the phone is absolutely spectacular order it in blackI have no complaints I did a market study since all my life I have used cell phones of 1 single sim and the one they were offering is double sim it's exactly the same the same features the model is 950F / DS I only use one sim buy a micro sd of 128 gigs and perfect..I bought it to the store that is called wireless place the shipment was super fast I arrived in a day everything sealed definitively if I had to buy another I would do with them.,33
3.0,SM-N950F + ATT (US) = Not Happy... LTE Speed = Lacking... Wifi Calling = Not Happening... Advanced Messaging = Think Again...,"January 6, 2018",1,"Just got this phone today SM-N950F and can say without a doubt that I am returning it. I have AT&amp;T; in the US and am switching from an Galaxy S8+ to this Note 8. Here are the problems I am having: 1) will not do carrier aggregation therefore maximum download is around 17mbps and upload is around 6mbps while in the exact same location my Galaxy S8+ download is 82mbps and upload is 44mbps. 2) AT&amp;T; will not provision LTE advanced features such as Wi-Fi calling or advanced messaging. 3) AT&amp;T; will not recognize the IMEI in order to push secondary LTE bands and with that also throttles your bandwidth...I use my phone heavily for work and require high bandwidth speeds for presentations, collaboration and other internet hog programs and therefore this specific model phone will not work for me and thought I should let everyone know what I'm experiencing. You can kind of somewhat band-aid fix some of the above issues by rooting your phone and loading custom firmware and ROMs but if I did that I could no longer user it for my job and therefore the phone is useless to me.....I love everything else about the phone including the gold color and am sad to have to send it back and go buy a dang AT&amp;T; branded one..",10
5.0,the cost was very good in comparison to others i looked at and considered,"January 6, 2018",1,"The shipping was fast, the cost was very good in comparison to others i looked at and considered, the phone is AMAZING!!! I’m actually in the Caribbean and it works like a dream. I bought it for my daughter’s 16th birthday and will buy another for myself once I have the funds seeing that the exchange rate is almost 3-1... making it $2400 my currency. All in all an incredible purchase she’s beyond happy and is still thanking me and hugging me and I’m happy with it as well!  The picture quality on this thing is out of this world",3
3.0,"Phone works great, and for the price is shouldn't be surprised ...","January 13, 2018",1,"Phone works great, and for the price is shouldn't be surprised that the phone i received was a Chinese model. Giving it three stars do to the fact that this was no where on the page's description. Although it said it was an internation version, not sure why the box was covered in Chinese.",4
3.0,The phone itself is very nice but my problem was with signal strength,"February 9, 2018",1,The phone itself is very nice but my problem was with signal strength.... Using both t-mobile and att Sims the signal was very poor compared to even the dual Sim blackberry keyone I have. Service would cut in and out like crazy on the note 8 on both Sims where as the keyone would have either 2-3 bars of lte...Unfortunately the phone had to be returned...,1
4.0,Best phone for 2017 and beyond,"February 23, 2018",1,"Had it for a couple hours and i absolutely love this. It came as described. Brand new sealed and all. The transition into this 18.5/9 ratio is quick after messing with settings, it made the phone even better from using gestures to get around and get the most out of the devics. This thing is fast and snappy, after changing a few settings and adding my fave launcher omg nothing can slow this down(for now). Theres only 2 things that im not entirely sold on. 1) on the back there is a DUOS branding(its not that bad but still takes away from the astetic. 2) this one is not entirely about the phone but more of the accessories it came with, since this is the international model it has a Europe charger but they did provide an adapter but it just makes the charger even more bulky.",0

But if you prefer that Samsung Pay not be locked to Chinese only, or the processor makes a difference to you, you may want to look elsewhere...Phone is great, the 3-stars are just for the fact that I didn't get what I ordered...",12

5.0,both ZDNet and Forbes reviewers said it was the best phone for business use compared to the IphoneX,"November 22, 2017",0,"I had held off buying this phone because of some reviews on the battery life. However, both ZDNet and Forbes reviewers said it was the best phone for business use compared to the IphoneX. My phone company gave me a 50% off deal and so I bought. Glad I did! The battery life has been great. I easily get through a 24 hour period with no more than 75% of the battery life used up. On light days I can get 48 hours of use before hitting the 25% left notice. Don't listen to those people saying they only get 4 hours. The only people getting that kind of result are doing a lot of streaming and game playing and there is no phone out there that will go more than 4 or 5 hours doing that. The Spen has become a good business tool for me and I'm now doing business on the phone I used to reserve for my desktop.

I purchased this sold and shipped by Amazon (not third party) and received a brand new model SM-N950F phone. Given how delicate the phone is, warranty is important to me. While I was informed it would be covered by Samsung's 1 year warranty even with it being an international model because I purchased it from an authorized USA dealer (sold and shipped by Amazon),  I ended up returning it. Why? While Samsung support will say the phone will be covered under warranty, in practice you won't be able to get it service as the Samsung repair centers won't touch international model phones. Call the actual Samsung phone service centers and ask. It sort of makes sense since they won't have all the same parts the international models have. If you can live with the risk of no warranty and it not being serviceable in the USA by Samsung repair centers, it's a fine phone.",3

Every app you download has its own cloud storage, every app has a monthly subscription and registration, if you don’t sign up and pay you will be bombarded with ads, each of these apps wants access to your entire phone like contacts, pictures, camera, microphone; otherwise you cannot even install the app, there is no privacy like on iPhone, i was absolutely horrified when I tried this thing, absolutely appalling, and customer service is absolute and utter garbage...Happily went back to iPhone and will never even dare trying android ever again, this phone costs as much as iPhone but processor is 2 generations older than iPhones’s, even an old iPhone beats this phone in multitasking, encoding video, 4K 60fps video, image quality, this phone is garbage.....",15
