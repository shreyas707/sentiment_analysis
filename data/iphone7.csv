1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"January 25, 2017",1,"Dont buy this item... Received today and I dont understand if I have purchased an iPhone or an Android. It brings Android software and it looks very very cheap!.Will add photos for you to all can see it. Just looking them its enough to understand its not an iPhone 7..It works very slow, the language is randomly changing between apps, it doesnt even have a good battery!.The serial number in the phone its not the same that the the one on the box..Its not fair, I will find a way to return it because I dont live at USA..ABSOLUTELY NOT RECCOMENDED, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.",283
5.0,Not all are completely unlocked.,"October 9, 2016",1,"Be careful, I ordered this phone and it wasn't an unlocked phone.  It is setup on the US Reseller Flex Policy.  It looked like it was purchased at Best Buy, ""sim free"".  I could not activate it with an international SIM Card.  Luckily I found someone with a US Verizon SIM card to install durning the activation process. Once it was activated with the Verizon card I was able to install my international Sim Card and everything worked...If you are looking to purchase one of these phones internationally make sure you have a US sim card to go through the activation process, or research the US Reseller Flex Policy..",438
1.0,Buyer Beware,"March 3, 2017",1,"BUYER BEWARE. I purchased this phone a few days ago, today it was delivered, the problem is that I opened the box and there was NO PHONE INSIDE. Only the charger and the headphones.",271
3.0,Finally got this supposedly unlocked phone unlocked,"May 7, 2017",1,This did not work with a UK SIM or a Bermuda SIM. Went to Apple Store in London who said to activate iphone with an iTunes restore. This did not work either - message that the SIM carrier was not supported always appeared. After reading reviews on here bought a cheap AT&amp;T; SIM which seemed to activate the phone but still did not unlock it as it was still locked for using other country SIM cards. I requested an unlock code from AT&amp;T; website 2 days ago as a last ditch attempt. They replied today and said they had approved the unlock and to go ahead and activate the phone..It now works with a non-U.S. SIM card finally so I am hoping it is unlocked for all GSM carriers worldwide..So the phone I received was actually not international unlocked but locked on to AT&amp;T; - even though it was described as factory unlocked for use worldwide.By the way when I contacted the Amazon Supplier they were extremely unhelpful...,8

5.0,Awesome Phone - worth upgrading!,"September 18, 2016",0,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6s..Camera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions...SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6...Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black...I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all...Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!..Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem...128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g...No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine...IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me...No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand...Hope this helps :)",192

4.0,6 months' review: iPhone 7 offers a sneak peak into the future -- a future that is worth waiting one more year for.,"December 17, 2016",0,"I got the iPhone 7 on launch day and have been using it daily for about six months now, and here are my thoughts.  A little background on myself: I'm a tech enthusiast who loves mobile computing and how it may enhance our lives.  Two years ago, I switched from Android to give the iPhone 6 a try (here is my review on the iPhone 6 https://www.amazon.com/review/R16NCAQFAEHRRY/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN;=B00NQGP42Y).  After 2 years, a lot has changed in both the Android and iOS systems, and it is worth taking a look at the newest phone from Apple to see how it stacks up...Many other customers have already described the pros and cons of the new iPhone, so I won't belabor all the points but will mention a few that need emphasis...Pros:.- Waterproof.  This is a big one, though Samsung has had it for a few years now.  The iPhone 7 is rated at IP67.  Since this is a brand new feature that Apple is introducing, I'll take some time to explain it.  IP means Ingress Protection, and Ingress just means ""access or entrance.""  Essentially, this rating shows how well protected the device is against different objects that could enter it.  The 67 is actually 2 different numbers rather than just 1 number.  The first number defines solid protection, and 6 is the highest rating (no ingress from solids or in layman's terms, dust tight).  The second number defines liquid protection, and 7 is the 2nd highest rating (out of 8) and it means immersion in liquid for up to 1m.  So you can take this phone into the rain and have no fear.  However, just a note, don't take this to the ocean just yet.  While the device is resistant against water, the seawater is a different story since it has a high salt concentration, and salt can ruin your electronics' ports.  In any case, this is certainly a step forward and something that customers have wanted in a long time.  Just to speak about the competition, the Samsung Galaxy S7 is rated IP68 (which is water resistant, rather than being just water proof).  If you are the average consumer, I don't think you will notice the difference...- Camera.  While the cameras have been improved for both the iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus, it is the 7 Plus that gets the dual camera that allows for extra zoom and portrait mode.  To briefly explain this new feature, the iPhone 7 Plus (not the 7 that is being reviewed here) has 2 camera lenses on the back, one that is 28mm and one that is 56mm.  In layman's terms, one lens has a much better zoom to focus on far away objects while the other lens can take pictures that are much closer (aka wide angle shots).  The dual camera system allows for more clarity and depth of field compared to a single lens camera, and, if you are intrigued to learn more, the dual cameras give the ability to capture what's called ""stereo photography.""  Anyway, if you get the iPhone 7 plus, you can take even better photos, especially portraits where the object/person is focused and the background is blurred.  This is a great improvement for the photographers out there. However, the competition is getting a lot closer than it used to be.  The Samsung Galaxy S7 arguably still has a slightly better camera while the brand new Google Pixel got the highest rating from DxO Mark (a highly reputable review site for cameras)...- Speed.  Snappy and responsive.  The fingerprint sensor is super fast compared to the iPhone 6 and much more so when compared to the iPhone 5s where the TouchID was first introduced.  I won't spend too much time here since many people have commented on the speed.  In essence, because Apple has total control over how apps are implemented and the hardware itself, the phone will feel very fast and fluid.  You can depend on this phone for quite a few years...- Speakers.  They are very nice.  You won't be able to tell that it is a front facing speaker on the top and bottom speaker working together.  They will create a nice sound environment and definitely loud enough to compete with all the other phones out there (and even some of the tablets)...- Battery life held up respectably for me, usually lasting me 1.5 days on a single charge.  I'm not a heavy user, however, so your mileage may vary.  In general, this delivered slightly better battery life than the iPhone 6 for me...Cons:.- Headphone jack.  This is a big drawback on a few levels.  1) There is no immediate benefit to the removal of the headphone jack. Yes, you do get more space for a little more speaker boost, but one can easily argue that most people will listen to their music more via headphones than just out of their phones.  2)  There are no good bluetooth headphones.  Sure, you can argue that some of the top tier headphone makers have nice bluetooth headphones, but those are inaccessible to most consumers because of the high sticker price.  I can't spend 100 bucks on a solid pair of bluetooth headphones, whereas I can spend about 100 to get the ATH-M50's (highly highly rated headphones) and enjoy studio quality sound.  This isn't just the fault of the manufacturers but also because the technology isn't there yet to deliver high sound quality wirelessly via bluetooth.  3) You can no longer listen to music on your headphones and charge your phone at the same time without using an expensive and glitchy dongle.  All of these points add up to inconveniences.  Apple described itself as taking ""courage"" to remove the headphone jack.  That argument is less convincing when you realize that they bought out Beats a while before releasing the iPhone 7...So those are the main points of the hardware.  Here are the points on the software..- The Apple ecosystem is getting tighter.  With the new updates in Apple TV, the new Apple Watch software, and the annual release of the macOS update, it is getting easier and easier to use all of your devices with Apple.  The ""everything just works"" still applies to the software (not to the hardware due to the increasing amount of dongles)..- However, you still can't manage storage well in the iOS.  For instance, my biggest disappointment is the fact that I can't easily delete data from apps.  Instagram may be taking up 900MB of storage because of all the photos that are stored in the app.  Can you just delete them and get on with life?  Not that simple... there isn't an option to do so.  You have to delete the whole app and then reinstall it to recover space..- What's changing is the fact that Apple's iOS now only leads in the ecosystem integration and maybe the number of apps.  Android is closing in fast while Windows is still trying to grow out of its teenage years.  Android is very impressive these days with the introduction of material design a few years ago.  The Android system no longer feels as ""techy"" but is becoming more and more fluid and user friendly..- Siri still lags behind Google's assistant, and that gap is only widening.  Google' AI is so much better compared to Apple.  If you own an iPhone and want to try out Google's latest and greatest, download Allo and give it a try.  You can have a conversation with AI and get responses that relate to the conversation.  You can ask ""who is the quarterback for the Cowboys?""  and then follow it up with ""when is their next game?"" and Google will answer both.  If you asked those 2 questions on Siri, it will not understand the ""when is their next game"" part because it wouldn't know to define ""their"" as the cowboys from the previous question...So, should you buy or upgrade to the newest phone from Apple?..No...Simply put, this is not the iPhone that you should invest money in unless you absolutely need the latest and greatest.  Here are the reasons.  1)  This is not the usual, big upgrade that we expect from Apple's 2-year major update cycle for iPhones.  This is mainly because next year, the iPhone will be having its 10 year anniversary, and you can bet everything you own that Apple will be unveiling a huge improvement at that time.  Rumors include everything from a ceramic casing to an all glass back, to wireless charging, to having dual cameras on the smaller iPhone 8 and not just the 8 Plus.  The list goes on and on, but all the rumors are telling us one thing: if you can wait one more year, this might be the year to wait on.  Sure, you can argue that one can always wait for the next phone.  But this is really true for this year's iPhone since the 10-year-anniversary will lead to a big unveil. 2) The world is slowly adapting to the post-headphones iPhone.  There aren't enough high quality but affordable accessories yet.  Let the market shape itself for a year and you'll get great accessory options with cheaper price tags.  The same goes for bluetooth headphones.  Sure we have some affordable options all over Amazon right now, but the sound quality is no where near a pair of wire headphones.  Also, the Apple's wireless ear buds are nothing too fancy in terms of sound quality, especially considering its price.  3)  The world of apps these days don't always take full advantage of the processing power of the newest iPhone.  This is mainly because the iPhones are so fast and so good these days.  In that sense, your iPhone 6 actually will work fine for a few years longer.  If you are an Android user and thinking about going over to the Apple world, hold off one year.  It'll be worth it...Okay, so I just told you a bunch of reasons for not getting the iPhone, but why the ""4 star review?""  Well, it is still a very well made, functional phone.  I took away one star because of the headphone removal.  Apple usually is good about removing a component when the market is mature enough to accept it.  When it took away the CD slots in MacBooks, the world was already heavily invested in USB drives.  Right now, the bluetooth headphone market is not mature yet, especially in the technology department.  The 3.5mm headphone jack is not on its way to obsolescence, and Apple admitted that when it introduced its new MacBook Pros that still had the headphone jack (and offered a weak excuse that music professionals may still use the headphone jack for other equipment... but iPhone users could be musicians too and use other equipment for certain apps, no?)!  So much for having ""courage.""..The future of mobile computing and personal computing points to universal stands (i.e. USB-C) and going wireless.  Samsung and Google's old Nexus line have had wireless charging capabilities for years, and other Android phones have pioneered the push for USB-C as a universal standard for computing I/O.  Apple has been dropping hints left and right this fall, first with the removal of the headphone jack and then with the introduction of the USB-C into its MacBook Pro line (now both the MacBook and the Pros have USB-C), to signal that it is moving towards universal standards and wireless.  The iPhone can already sync with iTunes wirelessly over WiFi.  Eventually, Apple will have a wirelessly charging phone, and that may occur as soon as next year.  With the iPhone 7, Apple is making a push towards a totally wireless mobile device, and that is an exciting future.  Yet, the world is not ready for that future just yet.  It is up to you whether to embrace that future now and be a dongle warrior or wait to let the rest of the mobile world and Apple's other products to catch up.  If I were in your shoes, I'd wait just one more year...Thanks for reading.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.",33

You can only use it on there network which is y i assumed i was order an UNLOCKED phone. And these people tried to play me by putting a Verizon sim card in it to make it seem like there is something wrong with the sim card, when really it is a Sprint phone the whole time. I'm disappointed and frustrated with the fact that this happened. And now i have to wait to get a shipping label, send it back, get reimbursed, buy another phone, and see if it will work this time.

5.0,PERFECT except for that missing headphone jack and tricky home button,"September 17, 2016",0,"I've been using this since 9/16/16 and here's my everyday person impression:..GOOD:.+ water resistant - this is a huge improvement for me!.+increased speed is noticeable w Siri..+the capacity is amazing! (I have the 256) I can keep movies, videos, books, photos, music etc without having to store on iCloud or the like (which usually involves a monthly fee)..+ decent size (same as iPhone 6S) while remaining portable and although not as big as the 7 Plus, it can still fit in pocket..+Widget feature (swiping to right at home screen) has been improved and now allows editing. You can add or delete features which can be key for privacy and being able to customize is always a good thing..+has lots of added fun features in iMessage (not sure if its the updated software or strictly iPhone 7) like memes, automatic replies and being able to write w your fingertip..+camera takes much better pics (increased the megapixels and the difference is noticeable) and it has 5X zoom capability..+has the fingerprint option for quicker access after you enter your 6 digit pass code to begin..+the style and sleekness of the new Jet Black option is a thing of beauty. It's almost criminal to cover it (but necessary for me)..+even slimmer than the iPhone 6 but still able to stand up against something for convenient viewing..+speaker upgrade as it now provides stereo (not up to audiophile standards but still)...BAD:.- no headphone jack!! but box includes dongle (see photo) which inserts into charging port and provides headphone jack - I have a bet with myself on how long it will take to lose. I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones..-the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button. It requires the right amount of pressure and despite offering three different options, not easy. The guys at the Apple Store need to stop showing off - on the bright side, I'm thinking it's a learning curve thing and continued use should take care of this issue...FINAL THOUGHTS: Is it worth the extra money? I'm not so sure but despite the two drawbacks, which I think are a temporary, I'm loving the features and ease of the iPhone 7 and the Jet Black is beyond elegant and sleek. I will provide update after continued usage........",120

4.0,I like the improvements. Giving 4.5 stars,"September 28, 2016",0,"I have both iPhone 6s and 7 and see some improvements...The iPhone 7 is almost identical to the iPhone 6s, but as we all know, lacks headphone jack...The improvements, that I’ve noticed so far are:..- better battery life.- slightly better photos (especially the ones in low light).- faster processor.- water-resistant.- brighter screen.- louder sound..The thing that took me a while to get used to is a new home button that is not ‘clickable’ anymore. I must say I preferred the old button. Now, I have the feeling that the click is happening ‘inside’ the Phone, rather than on its surface..It works perfectly well though...The lack of a headphone jack is a small con for now, since there’s no many lightning-compatible headphones yet. I hate the dongle so decided on buying the new headphones...They are pricey, but work great. When testing Siri( turns on after double tapping on the earpiece), they pick up voice pretty well, although I tried to speak very clearly..What is interesting, the audio pauses when you pop a headphone out when talking to someone - pretty nice feature..The AirPods’ battery lasts for 5-6 h of continuous use, although the voice calls use more energy..I’d recommend getting ones, since their quality is pretty good and they are easy to charge and store ( come with a case that recharges the pieces). The disadvantage is obviously the price… They’re also easy to loose...Forget about using wired headphones and charging in the same time… Unless you want to get another adapter, that will give you 2 lightning ports…  ( Offered by Belkin)..About the water resistivity:..That feature wasn’t meant to be tested but I accidentally dropped my phone to a sink with running water and it surviver…I wouldn’t recommend washing your phone when it gets dirty though…..Camera:..Unfortunately, the iPhone7 doesn’t have the second lens( as the iPhone plus has), The selfie camera was improved though, and I see a difference between evening photos taken with iPhone 6s and 7...The sound:..Significantly louder, stereo. (Could hear the music while doing my dishes)...The battery:..The new battery is much better. I can listen to the music almost all day long, browse the internet for a few hours, make couple of calls and use other apps without charging my iPhone7 in the middle of the day..I also noticed that it takes less to fully charge the phone...The Phone performance is quite faster. I feel it while editing pictures or playing games and stream music in the same time...Overall, I’m happy with the purchase even though I have iPhone 6s. The battery life, sound and water resistivity were convincing enough to give a new model a try...The con is that you must spend additional money on headphones (unless you want to use bangle or Lightning EarPods). The Apple’s wireless headphones are expensive, but definitely high quality...I am attaching a comparison between picture taken with iPhone 6 and 7...",27

I think so!,"September 29, 2016",0,"I'm back and it's better than ever..I was in the market for a new phone, and decided since it was the actual launch day, I'd go down to my ATT store and purchase something. I wasn't sure that I would purchase an iPhone 7 (honestly, about 80 percent sure I would) and I waited in line. The whole actual waiting part wasn't as tremendously large as it's quoted as being. I really didn't have to wait all that long, which I think is in part to a lot of people not seeing the potential in this phone...After I purchased the phone, I immediately went and got a Charging case from the same store. This not only allows me to charge my phone, but use my headphones at the same time. I don't have a need for headphones that I can lose (AIRPODS) and I like that Apple actually gives an alternative to you, you get to use corded earpods, and if your battery case is charged (essentially an external battery), you have about 1-2 days of full fledge battery life (and I use my phone a lot) and can still use the headphones...The speed of this one is what amazed me to be totally honest with you. I'm coming back to Apple after a small break and using a GoPhone (ZTE MAVEN) on the postpaid service. The Maven did well honestly, and I kept it around for a lot longer than I usually do. It just worked, and that can't be said for most phones. I'd experimented with iOS10 with my iPad, but I can say, it works a lot better on this than the iPad. Games, videos, even texting, are so much faster, it's hard to believe. The Digital Touch message feature is a nice touch, however, how much I'll use it I've yet to see...Having no physical home button is not a ""biggie"" to me. There is a haptic feedback button in place of this, which is essentially a touch sensitive button, but it actually has a feeling as though you're pressing it. It's kind of how the trackpad works on the MacBooks. A nice touch. It took a little bit to get used to, and choose the ""touch"" I wanted, but after doing so, it's been easy...I'm not displeased as many people would think about the headphone issue, as many people are. I use headphones, but so long as there is a workaround, which Apple has done, I'm not bothered. I can still use the earpods with the lightning connector. I guess it would be an inconvenience to you if your battery-case (if you bought one, or buy one) is dead, and I can actually see that being an issue. But this is why you need to watch battery levels...The camera is EXCELLENT. I've been a photographer for the better part of my life, and can leave my Nikon at home and walk out with this and be confident that any shots I need to take, can be taken with this. HDR is a must...Sound quality with this unit is very good, however, I must say, if you have a screen protector on the phone, you can legitimately feel the sound coming thru the speakers, thru the screen protector. Every phone that has had a screen protector that I've tested on the iPhone 7, has had this issue. All of the floor models that don't are fine. It doesn't bother me tremendously, but for a high end phone, you'd think that design would have been looked at before the phone was released...Overall, I'm pleased, and I think I will be for the foreseeable future. But I usually love almost every phone that I've owned, so, I'm not sure how biased I actually might be. As the experience continues, I'll be sure to update my review with any updates that would be beneficial.",14

5.0,Faster - Better Camera,"September 17, 2016",0,"i think the 7 or 7 Plus is well worth upgrading to. I have noticed a pretty large speed increase from my iPhone 6s. iMessage is a lot faster and snappier. Safari pages load quicker. Part of it could be iOS 10 which I did not install in my 6s but overall the 7 is faster and everything seems smoother...The lack of a home button has not bothered me at all. They have 3 home button setting, different settings - those seem like they do almost nothing. Mine was defaulted to setting 2 and I left if there. The Taptic feedback in the button area works great...I think the 32g - 128g - 256g is perfect. 32g will get most people by and 128 is plenty. 256 for those taking lots of pictures and videos. I am glad they canned the 16g...The camera is better,  low light shots look way better. I did not get the dual camera 7 Plus but the 7's camera definitely is improved...Colors - I have the Black and it looks awesome, no lines very clean look. The 7's camera is a bigger so it will not fit in most 6 cases. I saw the a Glossy Black and it is gorgeous but scratches easily. Most people will use a case so in the end the colors may not really matter. Only if you want a white from or black but the Black and Jet Black do look great...The 7 is a major upgrade over anything from the 6 on down. If you have the 6s you may want to try out a 7 and see if the speed and camera upgrades are worth it for you......",21
3.0,An OK phone for almost $1000,"October 27, 2016",0,"The long wait is over and the iPhone 7 is here any ready to be played with. The phone is very similar to the 6s model in the outside appearance. The phone itself is water resistant, but we noticed that it can be used completely under water without a case.  The phone is very durable and can be dropped. After dropping it a few times, the screen is still together, not cracked or shattered.  The battery life on the new 7 is very impressive, we can go an entire day without recharging..Even thou on specs it shows that the 7 has much better hardware, I've noticed that it lags often and at times has no response what so ever for a few seconds..The phone does not come with a head phone jack, sure most people have Bluetooth but when I'm sitting at an appointment waiting for the doctor, I usually don't have wireless headphone with me so can't watch YouTube or play games.  The display looks exactly like the 6s, I cannot tell the difference with my eyes..Overall I was expecting more from a $900 phone.  I can give it only 3 stars as there are just not many new features and there are plenty of phones with much better specs at a fraction of the price..If you found this review helpful please like it at the bottom..",11

4.0,Awesome phone!,"November 14, 2016",0,"Honestly I love the upgrade I made to the iPhone 7 (from iPhone 6). It is fast with the latest IOS 10 and loving the 128gb. I would not recommend getting the lowest space possible which is 32gb because it sucked having the 16gb iPhone 6. Also they did a study saying the 32gb model is slower as well. The one downside I have about the phone is the phone is missing the headphone jack, but they removed it so the phone could be water resistant and so they could put in a better vibration to the phone. They also removed the home button the takes place in every iPhone before the 7, but they replaced it with a touch button that tricks you into thinking it's a real button. Don't get this phone if you already have the iPhone 6s because it will not be a huge upgrade. PS. The pictures are ones I took on this phone, not pictures of the phone.",4

4.0,"Heads up about the new Haptic home button, it doesnt work etip or rubber gloves on","September 27, 2016",0,"THE HOME BUTTON ONLY WORKS WITH BARE HANDS...This means that I can no longer wear gloves while using my phone.  No gloves, not even E tip or rubber gloves.  None of them worked with my phone.  So if you work in the medical field, or as a mechanic keep this in mind.  Heck, even if you live where the weather is cold!  I even had to cut a hole in my arm bands clear plastic cover to access my phone...HERE IS A SOLUTION, ........with extra steps...I just found out there is a tweak you can do if you have to wear gloves:..Go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Accessibility and turn Assistive Touch on...This will add a virtual button that you can move around the screen called Assistive Touch dot.  Then to unlock your iPhone 7, press the sleep button on the right of the phone, then press the Assistive Touch dot, touch the home button and enter your SIX digit pass code...I want to share this with others, just in case they aren't into all of the extra steps to open the phone, because the extra steps are EACH time you have to access your phone...OTHER CONS..1.  I have it on the most sensitive touch and still have to press it rather hard.  It really was so much easier on my iPhone 5.  Also, it keeps opening Siri instead of accessing my home screen.  I have tried it on every sensitivity level..2. While the finger print thing is a cool feature, I have to do it several times before it works.  Then half of the time it ends up opening Siri and I have to shut her down and start over...I love everything else about my new phone and will leave it up to the other, more knowledgeable, reviewers to give you the details on the other aspects.........",15
4.0,"Miss the headhpone jack, here's a way to charge and use headphones at the same time...","September 21, 2016",0,Not an insane improvement over the 6 but the addition of water resistance is great (and long overdue).  I'm not a fan of the omission of the headphone jack.  This is especially an issue when you want to use the adapter to use your own headphones but also want to charge the phone at the same time (i.e. long flight while watching movies).  There is an adapter that will allow headphones AND charge at the same time (and this is what Apple should of included with the phone)  you can check it out here: http://amzn.to/2cutG5W,18

5.0,What Everyone Must Know About The iPhone 7,"November 8, 2016",0,"The advanced phone for 2016 has unique qualities, making this phone even better than the last. The buzz has been floating around on whether to invest in this product or not; this product is the iPhone 7. People have a frequent amount of questions that are holding them back from purchasing it. I have always been a fan of the Apple products. They are easy to operate and work fast. Yes, they are spendy, but they are well worth it as long as you take care of them..This model of the iPhone has improved tremendously. Apple has rebuilt the chip for this iPhone, resulting in the functioning speed of the phone increasing. This original chip has made the LTE two times faster than the iPhone 6. Keeping up with the Samsung line of phones, Apple has revised their phones to be splash- and dust-resistant. This is a wonderful benefit; a little water could slow your phone down or even lead to permanent damage..In the additon to the remodeling of the chip and resistance features, Apple has also giving the home button a new look. Now the home button is stronger and sturdier, preventing it from breaking when dropped or tossed around, which has been a problem with the previous iPhone. The outcome from dropping your iPhone could result in the button becoming loose or falling out and the malfunction of the Touch ID. The new home button is pressure sensitive making it more responsive to your touch making it easier to open your phone. The phone responds back to you with a customized vibration when opened.  The home button has been reengineered, making your Touch ID more secure and faster. There are some things to consider however. The glass screen goes all the way to the corners of the phone. Given that, when you drop this phone and it bounces from corner to corner or lands face down, it could shatter the screen. This could cause your front camera to malfunction or even permanently damage your phone..A vast topic that has been discussed immensely among my friends and I has been about the removal of the headphone jack. Some said that it was foolish of Apple to do something like that. Teenages cherish the use of music. They use it very often throughout the day while doing different activities. They feared the lack of the headphone jack would bring extra unnecessary expenses for wireless headphones. If you are uncomfortable with the wireless headphones, Apple has made a solution for you. The iPhone 7 provides a cord that has the headphone jack at the end. All you have to do is insert this two-inch cord into the charger portal. If you are in favor of the wireless headphones, Apple provides you with your first pair with the purchase of the iPhone 7. If you’re not much of a headphone person and just like to blast your music, the new “stereo” feature allows you to enjoy music better than ever. I have fantastic news for you: this new stereo is twice as loud as the one in the iPhone 6. There is a speaker located at the bottom and top of the phone, allowing the sound to travel around the room, making it louder. The iPhone 7 is the first device in Apple to have a stereo speaker implemented to one of their phones..Furthermore, iPhone owners have received an entirely new camera. There are now two cameras that shoot at once to give you an astonishing and lively photo that appears in HD. I truly admire this feature, coming from a teenager who enjoys taking pictures to capture memories. This camera is a great asset to any iPhone owner that cherishes every memory they hold and want to have it in a high quality photo. Based off an unanimous review on the CNET website, customers from Apple really enjoy having optical image stabilization. Along with that, the new camera delivers improved photos, especially in low light..Have you ever been in a situation when you want to capture the moment to have the memory forever only to find you’re out of storage space and cannot take a picture? There are new GB that are larger (128 and 256), giving you the ability to store more on your phone. No more worries about having to go through your pictures every month to get them printed off or about having to delete them. With this extra storage, you will never run out of storage. Additionally, one thing I absolutely admire since I'm a teenager is the battery life. When I had the iPhone 6, I had to charge my phone up to two or three times a day. I always had two portable chargers with whenever I was away from home. The battery life on this phone is out of this world. If you aren't on it often, it could last you up to two days before it dies. If you’re a busy teenager like me, always doing something on your phone, the charge lasts throughout the whole day. No more having to carry bulky portable chargers around. CNET also states how wonderful the battery life of this iPhone is; this just further proves how worthwhile the purchase of this advanced phone is..Apple has made minimal, but effective changes to the specifics of the iPhone 7. They have created new colors for this phone including new black and jet black. The size of the iPhone 7 is equal to that of the iPhone 6 with its length and width; it is a bit thinner due to the fact that it lacks an auxiliary jack. The iPhone 7 is also available in the plus size for people who like a bigger screen. The display on the phone is the same so you don’t have to get use to a new display format. Following that, the brightness of the screen has improved immensely. This new quality has brought colors alive, making them bolder and lively. The IOS display and features is the same throughout all Apple products; your iPhone 7 automatically comes in the newest IOS form..The overall review for this phone is an eight point seven out of ten. Based on reviews from others, they seem to really enjoy this phone along with everything it offers. I’d say you are getting your money's worth. I’ve had the iPhone 7 for a couple months now and I haven't had any problems with it. I love the advanced technology it offers. The extended battery life and the new camera is the overall reason to purchase this phone. A bonus feature to me is the new stereo speakers it has because I’m a teenage who listens to music every chance I get; these new speakers are insane. Your music is loud and fills the room. Apple has really thought out of the box on this phone. If you aren't an Apple lover yet, then join the Apple family and get the iPhone 7..",3
5.0,The philosophy of continuous improvement,"July 29, 2017",0,"As a several years’ iPhone user, a washing machine-related mishap with my 5s led me to upgrade to the new 4G iPhone 7...The regular 7 is the ideal size to fit your pocket and very lightweight, but a larger version of the phone is available for avid gamers who like a bigger screen and which has more camera functions too, with a £100 price premium...The main takeaways:..1. The iPhone design as ever is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use. The 7’s case-colours are subtle and classy-looking with black, grey and metallic pastels endowing the phone with a quality image..2. The screen is a big leap forward from the 6, with clear bright graphics and allowing you to choose icon and text size (perfect for those of us whose vision isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be). The regular 7 seems to have finally got the balance right between a good usable screen size and convenient portability..3. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, using the phone in landscape format has the effect of widening the keypad..4. The ring tone &amp; speaker volume is clearer &amp; louder on the iPhone 7 than any of its rivals..5. The new cordless airpods sense when they’re in your ears and pause when you remove them, so finally an end to earphones with trailing cables..6. The iPhone 7 is splashproof and may be immersed in water for a time without damage; Apple though does not guarantee the phone will remain undamaged if it is accidentally left in a pocket and subsequently endures a complete wash/spin cycle..7. There’s no doubt about it, the new dual camera system on the 7 is fantastic..8. There are three options for memory capacity (naturally with rising price tags as you go up): 32G, 128G and 256G. I would suggest that unless you’re continuously streaming hi-def videos and downloading big games, 32G is going to be enough for most users with a storage capacity such that you’re unlikely to ever need more..9. Everything you do on the phone including your contacts may be backed up on the i-cloud, so should your phone be lost and not recovered, a new one may be easily reconfigured with your preferred settings and contact database..Gripes: very few -..1. The battery life isn’t great but is an improvement on the 5 and 6, and moreover you can now buy a phone case incorporating 24-hours of extra battery life, though it makes the phone more bulky..2. The price of the 7 is high for a buyer on a modest income, but as usual you get what you pay for and this is a premium product..It’s easy to see why Apple maintains market leadership with such excellent products and back-up service through their funky high street/mall Apple stores full of knowledgeable, intelligent and helpful staff. Make sure you buy a screen protector and a silicone rubber-back case to protect the sides of the phone in case it gets accidentally dropped on the street – which it eventually will...Finally, some one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked or otherwise non-functional phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. One solution is to buy from an Apple store; they’ll set up the new iPhone for you, transfer all your contacts, settings and data from your old phone and be available to resolve any subsequent issues..",1

1.0,I hate the 7; buy a 5 instead,"January 29, 2018",0,"The iPhone 7 is a serious step backward by Apple.  Prior to this, my biggest complaint was the battery life.  However, I could have the phone plugged in charging, while listening to music on my headset or talking on the phone.  With only 1 plug now, instead of 2, you can either charge your phone OR use your headset, but not both.  Further my old headsets do not fit the 7, and the 7 headset won't fit my iMac.  I bought two splitters and adapters and the splitters did not work, and the adapter is hard to keep up with...Second, the touch screen is insensitive and about 1/3 of my touches are not detected.  There is a heavy and a light touch but when holding the phone with one hand and / or typing quickly, you cannot control the different touch levels...In the past, when you bought an Apple product, you got a solid operating system that had been thoroughly tested and you did not have to update all the time.  Not anymore; you can spend as much time updating your phone and apps as you spend using it now...Many of the new features are a nuisance unless you are a teenager, and you cannot turn them off, and they constantly try to cram the Apple Subscription Music service down your throat. I want to turn that feature off, and not be asked about it another hundred times...I loved my old iPhone 5 despite the short battery life.  Given the computing power of the phone, I could understand that, and had back up battery packs I could use.  But I hate my iPhone 7 and would highly recommend against buying one...",0
4.0,Improvements over the 6S!!,"September 23, 2016",0,"The iPhone 7 offers some incremental upgrades over the 6S. Here are some of the things improved upon and the things to take note...- Better display (wider colour gamut).- Better taptic engine.- 5 grams lighter.- IP67 Water and dust resistance.- Way better A10 Fusion CPU.- Slightly better front camera (1080p front camera recording vs 720p).- Rear camera have OIS.- Better low light performance.- Cat 9 LTE vs Cat 6 LTE.- Slightly better battery life.- Solid state capacitive home button (1 less mechanical part to worry about, esp for water resistance)..The new iPhone does not have a headphone jack and there are some people reporting that the audio quality is not as good as the 6S after using the lightning to headphone jack adapter. Just to take note. Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs. Again, good to take note on!.",7

After 6 month it does not work anymore (touch screen does not work well, main home button does not work at all). I contacted the seller who did not help me and did not accept return or refund. Keep in mind that according to APPLE, the manufacture give you only few month of warranty while the seller has to guarantee 2-year warranty. With this seller and Amazon you have only 45 days warranty!!! So after that time frame (e.g. your iphone breaks 12 months after you buy it) you have not protection from Amazon and you just waste your money. So be careful.",6
5.0,Another Apple product to add to my collection,"October 19, 2016",0,"I have owned iPhone since the release of the 4 and have never found another phone that I like to make me consider jumping ship to another company. I upgraded to the Jet Black 128GB iPhone 7 from a 6 so there are certainly many features that were added...Pros:.-Very fast...noticeable difference in speed. ****FYI: MANY PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE THERE IS A DIFFERENT IN SPEED BETWEEN THE 32GB and other models. SO if you didnt buy it yet keep that in mind. For the extra storage, more powerful camera and speed its worth the additional $100.****.-Nice color options (love my Jet Black).-Battery life is improved. I get through a whole day of use with no issues and normally have at least 25% left at the end of the day..-Camera on the front is now almost the same quality as the rear camera on the 6.-New home button feels more responsive.-Finger print scanner opens with no hesitation...Cons:.-Jet Black does hold finger prints very bad...so if your anal about that you may want the other models outside of the black ones. Both attract finger prints equally but the Jet Black does scratch a little easier. Just keep it in a case OR get a naked skin if you prefer the no case look, problem solved!.- Headphone jack - I wouldnt say this is a full con....rather a life style adjustment. The first 2 weeks I did have several 'son of a b****!' moments where I didnt have my dongle. I keep the apple provided one in my car attached to my AUX cord and have no issues.

1.0,Total rip-off these phones are defective.,"November 12, 2017",1,"I bought this phone back in February and it developed a hardware issue. My phone (Iphone 7 128GB) recently developed an issue in cellular signal, still searching for network and could not recognize the carrier, so i did a reset of network settings and restart the phone then the screen goes to black and white lines and the phone restart itself continuously tell i remove the SIM card or put it in airplane mode, and i have been tried another SIM cards but the problem still exist..Thereafter, i connect it to ITunes and ITunes told me that you have to update phone to IOS V. 11 but actually i already updated my phone to IOS V.11. then i tried to update the phone but unfortunately the process failed with the unknown error (-1) and the phone currently stuck in a recovery mode and also i tried restore process and face the same error. I took very good care of this phone bear in mind, it's in near mint condition. So disappointing that they do this to people. Never buy a phone off of Amazon, its too much of an investment to risk buying from these shady sellers. Buy it from your carrier, get a protection plan and warranty otherwise you'll be stuck with a $800.00 piece of metal and glass and the seller will tell you ""It's your problem now, sorry."" I went through Apple and T-Mobile neither of the two could do anything about it..",1

1.0,iPhone 7 is a disappointment to me,"November 13, 2016",0,"As an iPhone user for 5 years, iPhone 7 is a disappointment to me. Apple officially introduced its next-generation of smartphone. The company claimed their new iPhone as the best one they have ever released. It is equipped with a more powerful processor, upgrades in camera performances, the strips at the back are more reasonably laid out, a new special color, and the removal of the 3.5mm audio jack...Apple used to be the leading company in innovation of its product that took over the smartphone market a couple of years ago. But now Apple charges hundreds of dollar for an iPhone 7 which has mostly the same functions compared with an iPhone 6. My friend bought an iPhone 7 right after it was released and it looks exactly the same with the iPhone 6. Both devices have the same screen size, same display solution, same processing system, and slightly bigger camera...The biggest problem of iPhone 7 is the iOS 10. Force Touch technology enhances the touch sensitivity on the device, and this enhancement have been used on devices such as the Apple Watch, and the trackpad on MacBook. However, in this operating system iOS 10, when Force Touch is used to reply to messages from the lock screen, the screen would become stiff. The only way to solve this is to restart the device. iOS 10 also has problems with Reduced Motion. This is a new function for users to create an iOS 3D motion display on the lockscreen wallpaper. But the use of iOS 10 Reduced Motion will cause other applications like Safari to slow down or inoperable. I haven’t mentioned about uploading videos and photos on Facebook will force the application to stop working, soundbar speakers outside interference even with plug connector along with 3.5 mm standard headphone speakers, reboot sudden catastrophe, Siri function is unstable when asked the name often throw out, bluetooth audio stutters tone and screen lock sound unquenchable, and self-disconnecting device with accessories...Lastly, the removal of the 3.5 mm audio jack. This change is unnecessary. Bluetooth headphone development in smartphone brands including iPhone has been introduced a long time ago. So why did Apple remove headphone jack? Is this the way for Apple to charge more additional cost on its customers? The price of an iPhone climbs up every year and now customers have to pay more money to buy the Airpods or Earpods with Lighting connector. Now you are only get to choose listen to music or charge your phone, the only way to listen to music and charge your phone is buying a 150.00$ Airpods set. iPhone 7 is a good product with pretty strong processing system and nice looking design, there is no doubt about that. But is it worth to spend 780.00$ plus an additional cost of 150.00$ for a phone that you can spend the same amount of money and buy a high-end smartphone that has the same functions or even better of other brands that cost only about 500.00$-650.00$ or so like Samsung, Sony, and LG..",8
5.0,A worthy phone..,"October 10, 2016",0,"I bought this phone about 3 weeks back from my carrier. I was an android user and moved to iPhone..My first thoughts on this:.Design - This phone has a similar design to that of the iPhone 6s except the antenna lines at the back and the minor camera bump. Overall the design of this phone is phenomenal. It looks premium yet sturdy. I bought this in Matt Black and it looks premium. It gives a totally different look for this phone as the whole phone including the screen is in black..Hardware - The hardware specs of this phone are of top notch. Its one of the fastest phone in the market and I can clearly feel it when I compare to my old Nexus 5. The fingerprint unlock is so fast and snappy that it has almost zero lag from humans perception..Software - With iOS 10 there are couple of worthy improvements in this phone. One of them is the swipe right to get the general information about things to do. This is similar to the android's google now on right swipe. iMessage is the best messaging experience on any phone or platform. One feature I miss is the swipe on type which would make it really easy to type some common words. Although autocomplete for apple keyboard is pretty good but swiping made things much better for common words..Camera - The camera of this phone is one of the best. Although I was a bit confused between 7 and 7 plus due to the dual camera, I went with this phone for its size. The camera is instant at taking pictures and photos in low light are fantastic..Battery - I am impressed with the battery of this phone as of now. It lasts a whole day without charging.",1
1.0,Good hardware but the operating system leaves a great deal to be desired - better to go with Android phone,"November 9, 2016",0,The operating system is still not finished and it takes more than 10 minutes to establish a wi-fi connection. Whether at home or at the office or a public hot spot I find myself waiting for up to 15 minutes to get a WiFi data connection. Apple tech support people are clueless about networking devices and have recommended deleting all network connections which did not help or doing a full reset of the phone which wasted 2 days to download everything all over again and still did not help...Updates are more than 1GB for the operating system and over 2GB for iTunes which is needed to do any sort of backup from the iPhone to a computer and Apple's trying to force everything through iTunes is as dumb a design as Microsoft's reliance on the registry...Strongly recommend buying an Android OS based smartphone like the Pixel from Google. The Apple smartphone operating system leaves a lot to be desired if you want to connect to the internet or a local LAN and not rely 100% on cellular data with its high cost and slow speeds..,7
5.0,... already I can say I have grown to really like the phone compared to the ones before,"September 27, 2017",0,"Being a previous generation iPhone user and after having the iPhone 7 for over a year already I can say I have grown to really like the phone compared to the ones before. The most notable improvements from the generations before are the photo quality. It was a huge jump going from an 8 mega-pixel camera to a 12 mega-pixel camera, as well as adding the live picture feature to take pictures while in motion and still get a clear image. Although it is not the best camera because the new Samsung galaxy s8 has a 12 mega-pixel camera built in as well. The battery life has significantly increased from the 6 to the 7 as well, I know this first hand because I have owned both and when I had my iPhone 6 the battery life lasted me maybe a half a day and now with the 7 I can go through a full day doing the same activities with my phone on the same charge. Another interesting feature is the water resistance of the new iPhone 7; in the past, I have gone through two iPhone 6 that have been ruined by water damage and since I have had the 7 I have fallen victim of a prank in which my friends threw buckets of water drenching my clothing and my phone was in my pocket. I pulled out the phone and to this day there are still no signs of water damage whatsoever. A new and interesting feature in the new models of the iPhones are the stereo speakers and they give a clear crisp sound as compared to the speakers in the iPhone 6. Of course, every good thing will still have its flaws and any company has yet to make the “perfect” smartphone. The flaws in the iPhone 7 are that they removed the headphone jack and everything runs through the charging port of the phone. This is a real pain in the neck because you would have to choose between charging your phone or listening to music unless you purchase an adapter or of course if you have Bluetooth accessories. All being said, I would definitely recommend this product to people.",1
1.0,No bang for buck,"October 28, 2016",0,"For how much i paid, the features are nominal. Can't charge and use headphones at the same time. It doesn't really sound much better either. The performance is comparable to older models and cheaper non-apple products and doesn't really stand out. I've used a lot of devices too. You pay for the apple name but not really a superior phone. As far as the headphone jack goes, a tech at the apple store said it was made this way to enable its water resistance. The new samsung phones are water resistant and still have headphone jacks. If, for apple, the technology to do both doesn't exist for them yet, they need to stop dragging ass. Now the screen. Good screen i guess. Not as good as the oled of samsung tho for sure. Handheld oled has atleast been around since the 2012 G1 Psvita which looked AMAZING. it was only $250 back then too. The performance and responsiveness are very good but unfornately for apple that's the norm across the board (nexus lg samsung etc). Comparable performance with inferior hardware and display for more $ than another brand was a poor desicion for me. I was simply just not impressed and quite frustrated trying to use the device compared to samsung or lg. One star for functioning as advertised (aka its a phone and will work as such when you need it to)",8
5.0,The Pinnacle of the iPhone Experience,"October 4, 2016",0,"Design..This is the best looking iPhone yet in my mind. First off the antenna lines on the rear of the phone are moved more to the top and bottom of the phone and blend in more than they did on the iPhone 6/6S. Even better, if you have the black or jet black versions, they don’t really show up at all. Overall, it looks similar to the 6/6S, but feels like the final, evolved version of the design. The size feels great and overall, it is just a beautiful phone...As stated above, the iPhone 7 has added both black and jet black colors. They haven’t utilized a true black color since the iPhone 4/4S, and these new colors truly look so much better than the space gray of old. Also as mentioned, they almost completely hide the antenna lines which is a huge plus. My personal pick would be the jet black, but the regular black looks much better in real life than it does on the Apple website where it looks more gray than it truly is. You can also still get the phone in gold, silver, and rose gold variations...The home button is now not an actual “button,” but utilizes the 3D touch like capability to simulate the idea you are pressing a button. The settings options gives three different modes to simulate this, and after only a day, I completely got used to it. The fingerprint sensor is as fast as ever which makes unlocking your phone a consistent and seamless experience. I have faced very few occasions where my fingerprint didn't accurately register...The iPhone series has officially become waterproof! By doing this, it makes me feel so much more secure in just the day to day tasks of using my phone. If I’m caught in a rainstorm, it is reassuring to not have to tuck the phone and run like a football player. It is also dustproof and is rated IP67 which means it is certified to be resistant for up to three feet for thirty minutes...Camera..The rear camera is stronger than ever on the iPhone 7. It has an improved 12MP camera that takes excellent pictures. The regular version of the iPhone finally has OIS (optical image stabilization) just like its big brothers, the Plus series. The pictures it takes are clear, capture a great amount of light, and due to the OIS, rarely come out blurry. The camera loads lightning fast and is overall just a spectacular camera...The front camera also took another bump up to 7MP. The combination of the improved resolution, consistent retina flash (front flash), and speed are excellent on the front camera. I still wish it had a wider field of vision, but other than that, I have no complaints about the front camera...Display..The Retina display is the same as it has been since the iPhone 4. 326 pixels per inch is a good looking display. It certainly does not compete with some other phones and their higher resolution screens, but for now, the screen still gets the job done. I would like to see them improve this in the next installment, but it is still a pleasing screen to view at 4.7 inches...The brightness is outstanding and it also drops very low too, which is a benefit if you are trying to read something in a dark room. According to Apple the brightness is better than ever, but I have not noticed any discernible difference in that area...Audio..The audio is excellent. It finally has stereo speakers where sound comes out the bottom right speaker grill and the top speaker on the front of the screen. Having stereo speakers, along with a front facing one makes such a difference when listening to music or watching a video. It sounds great and just makes the listening experience so much more enjoyable.  This is certainly one of the biggest improvement areas over last year. Also, in terms of the big headphone jack controversy, it does actually come with a lightning to 3.5mm converter, so you can still use headphones with it...Battery..Battery life has improved over the 6S and SE. On daily use, I have gotten a couple more hours of use per day. I would still welcome faster charging options, but this is a nice step up from previous generations. It has increased to 1,960 mAh battery which makes a difference...Functionality..This is the pinnacle of the IOS software experience. The 2GB of RAM, the A10 processor, and the implementation of IOS 10 is great. Everything runs well and quickly. Also, the fact that the storage sizes have all doubled to 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB is fantastic, as 16GB is a very antiquated notion. Expandable storage would be welcome, but due to how IOS is more locked down and for monetary reasons, I understand why that won’t most likely be a feature in the near future...The software is clean, smooth, and works well. There are still a few pet peeves such as not being able to close all the apps down at once or not being able to make simple changes such as changing the color of text messages instead of just grey, blue, and green without jailbreaking the phone. But that is also part of its strength. Everything on the phone has been glossed to a high sheen, and almost everything runs well. IOS is simple, straightforward, and I look at it like a menu at a restaurant: it may not have the largest selection or allow you to ask for substitutions, but what you did get is mostly excellent...If you would like to read more of my reviews, please check out: smartphonehaven.com...",4

2.0,I was hoping for better.,"March 8, 2017",0,"I’ve had my IPhone 7 for close to a month now, and feel like I know it well enough to write a knowledgeable review of it. My previous phone was a BlackBerry Z30..First I have to say is that I’ve been working at a factory on a 20 plus acre complex that employs about 700 people in Worcester MA for 6 years now. It is common knowledge among us, that the only carrier with a constantly reliable signal at this plant is AT&amp;T.;.That having been said, my Z30 could go on Verizon’s network with a signal  anywhere from no signal to 2 bars of 4 G, with the average being about 1 bar of 3G, and no signal being more common than a 4 G signal..The IPhone 7 is much worse. The range is between no signal to 1 bar of 3 G, the average being about 1 bar of 1X, and no signal being the most common of all. I could just shut it off, it’s that bad. I really didn’t know I had it so good with the Z30..So, if you plan on using this phone in a weak signal area, I would recommend you get different phone, because this phone’s antenna is also weak!.Next is, I miss the BlackBerry Hub, all communications in one place. Phone, e-mail and messaging, all together in chronological order, or separate also in order..I’ve installed Yahoo mail and get widgets of my e-mail on my home screen. Usually just one line of each new e-mails, but doesn’t get fully down-load it into e-mail app. So, if I’m at work and get an e-mail I want to read in its entirety, I have to wait for my hopefully 1 bar of 1X to do it. The Apple’s e-mail app was just as bad, it just doesn’t do the widgets. Not HAPPY! My old BlackBerry put everything into the hub without me asking for it to do it! When there was no signal, it would constantly look for one, and when it found one, it would do whatever was needed to be done. No input from me needed. It also had the battery power to do it all day. Happy with the IPhone battery so far..I also don’t like that everything the IPhone does is cloud based, I get next to no signal 45 plus hours a week, the cloud is useless!.If I sound like I miss my old BlackBerry. I do, but I’m still trying my best to adjust to this IPhone. The jury is still out..",0
3.0,Headphone jack idiocy!,"May 27, 2017",0,"The phone is beautiful and works great, however getting rid of the headphone jack is the stupidest thing they'be could've done. This is trying to find a solution to a problem that did not exist... who are/were the people that we're complaining about the 3.5 mm? So basically I can't listen and charge my phone at the same time, or have to buy an additional cord with two tails, if I want to use any high end 3rd party headphones, car connections, etc, you have to have this stupid little cord attached to the phone always.  The phone looks absurd with two little tails dangling of it. This is a great phone until someone very stupid tried to simplify the phone and ended making it less functional...  this bothers me everyday. I give it 3 stars because when you don't have to use the headphones the phone is great. I hope they reverse course, or I may really consider going to android...",0
2.0,"no apple, you STILL can't play the SLR card","January 9, 2017",0,"I'm still offended by Apple playing the SLR card...Even the iphone 6 at its 8MP actually looks better than the iphone 7 at 12MP for macros, and other outdoor shots...The stabilization added in the 7 will help but in any form of action shot, it would be blurry and under low light indoors, all iphones are quite poor...I doubt we'll see a xenon flash on the iphone 8, perhaps the 9? This of course leaves the Lumia 1020 pureview 41mp a superior shot and actually the stabilization is better there too. Alas, there is not always an app for that, with windows mobile...If you have an older iphone, wait it out.  Grab a pentax q-s1 for cheap and fun shots (along with a wifi SD card).",0

There are still a few pet peeves such as not being able to close all the apps down at once or not being able to make simple changes such as changing the color of text messages instead of just grey, blue, and green without jailbreaking the phone. But that is also part of its strength. Everything on the phone has been glossed to a high sheen, and almost everything runs well. IOS is simple, straightforward, and I look at it like a menu at a restaurant: it may not have the largest selection or allow you to ask for substitutions, but what you did get is mostly excellent...If you would like to read more of my reviews, please check out: smartphonehaven.com.",3
5.0,The best Phone Period,"June 24, 2017",0,"This is Phone is absolutely amazing. I have been an avid iPhone user since the start. Apple has definitely done it again with the iPhone 7. The screen is amazing. The resolution and color contrast are on point. The new haptic feedback, is is useful and versatile allowing Apple to make the phone completely waterproof. The phone is super fast and never hickups or anything regardless of what I throw at it. You have to love the amazing customer service Apple provides anytime you have an issue or don't know what to do. Effeminately the best phone on the market and kills any Android.",0
3.0,"Camera : dull depressing colors, unattractive selfies.  Needs color photo software upgrade.","May 1, 2017",0,"Good : 1) dual lens zoom and 2) fingerprint sign in are more useful and convenient than I expected...Camera : dull depressing colors, unattractive selfies.  As a photographer/shutterbug, I was very disappointed.  The so called 'natural' colors make pictures boring and ugly.  Trees and grass have dull dirty green.  Selfies skin tones are yellowish, brownish and unhealthy looking, like there's jaundice.  Wrinkles are pronounced.  Lens has a face widening, fattening effect.  Lens distortion.  For these reasons I am considering of selling my 7+ for a Samsung S8+.  7+'s Low light is terrific for a camera phone.  But when I read it is DSLR level, nonsense.  When other cameras phones give beautiful pictures, selfies, have beautifying software, iphone 7 is left in the dust.  Pictures and selfies to many consumers are VERY important...Minimal VR support.  Another reason I am thinking of selling the phone for a Samsung.  Even though Samsung is not a nice company...7+ uses LCD screen when even my mid range Samsung J7 has OLED and much deeper blacks.  Iphone 7+ screen is beautiful but the blacks are not as deep...Not much technological and design innovation.  Just a nice 'luxury' item.  Apple needs to up their game...",0
5.0,Wow!  Worth the upgrade from a iPhone 6S to 7,"December 1, 2016",0,"My background: I've used 2 Samsung for 5 years (since 2011) before I switched to my first Apple iPhone in 4/2016...I've had the Apple iPhone 6S for 6 months and that was better than Samsung in terms of wifi not draining my battery, Facetime video, iTunes, frequent iOS security upgrades, and fingerprint reader to login to the phone and some apps...The iPhone 7's camera is so much better than then iPhone 6S in low light indoors and the optical stabilization for videos sold me on the upgrade.  The extra 2 hours of battery life is a bonus.  The surprise is that the fingerprinter reader is so much more accurate with dry hands, and sweaty hands.  Another surprise is that I can set home button to triple click to bring up the magnifying glass app so I can read fine prints..",0

4.0,Great Phone,"September 21, 2017",0,"The iPhone 7 is a great phone for everyday tasks.  The phone has a very solid build with a metal back and a matte black finish that doesn’t slip in your hand.  The matte black also doesn’t show fingerprints like most shiny phones do.  The front of the phone is a durable glass that does show fingerprints but cleans easily and is scratch resistant.  The power and volume buttons are placed nicely on the sides where they are rarely accidentally pressed but can be easily pressed when needed.  The overall size of the phone is great with it not being too large where you can’t access all of the screen with one hand but is still large enough to easily read any text and watch any videos..The iPhone 7 also has a new home button that doesn’t physically move like previous iPhone’s did.  Having previously owned an iPhone 6 the button is very different on this new phone but is very easy to get used to.  The amount of haptic feedback is adjustable so you can make it feel exactly how you want.  After just a few hours with the phone the new home button seemed just as natural as the previous home button.  Included in this home button is a fingerprint scanner that is much faster than the scanner in the previous phones..Although the iPhone 7 was the first iPhone without a headphone jack, it isn’t a large issue for day to day use.  There are many Bluetooth headphone options that allow you to listen to music or other media while also charging your phone.  Since the phone doesn’t have an audio jack there is another speaker on the bottom that makes the speaker quality much better and louder than previous iPhones..The front and rear facing cameras on the phone are both very good for their respective tasks.  For those looking for a more professional photograph the iPhone 7 plus may be the better option.  For the everyday user that isn’t serious into photography they both take very good pictures..Overall the iPhone is a great improvement from previous generations of iPhones.  The overall build quality and design make it a very good looking and durable phone.  This phone is great for those who use their phones for everyday communications, playing games, and just about every other task a smart phone can do...",0
5.0,I absolutely love Apple I was living off an iPod touch on ...,"February 10, 2018",0,"Not a single regret about this Apple product, it makes life a whole lot easier. I absolutely love Apple I was living off an iPod touch on Wi-Fi for 2 years before I even got an official iPhone. I have had the iPhone 7 128GB for about 10 months now about almost a year. It has given me no problems whatsoever in the time span that I have had it for. I have the matte black 128GB regular iPhone it is so amazing for my school life and job I can multitask everything. The battery on the iPhone 7 is so amazing it last the whole day even when I am scrolling through social media and listening to music. The iPhone comes in 2 choices for memory and that is probably the sucky part you have to choose between a 32GB or a 128GB for the difference of 100$. Apple is an amazing company but the GB thing is what mostly everyone ever really complains about. The iPhone does not have expandable memory like android with an SD slot.  Before switching to the iPhone 7 I had the iPhone 5 and that was a 64GB which they don't offer as an option of phone memory anymore so I went for the 128GB because I knew I was going to need all that memory. Another bad thing is that it is “Water Resistant” not “Waterproof”, it can get wet just not as much as you'd like before it is considered water damage. If you want to protect your prestigious phone I recommend protection for it such as a case or a glass protector..The upside of the iPhone 7 was that Apple has its products already built in with virus protection built in the price. If I were to get on a prohibited website or such content like that the phone would either warn me or straight up kick me out of it. The phone never really freezes with so much happening on the inside of it. The camera is so amazing on the phone it captures absolutely everything. The documents are stored inside your iCloud so if anything were to happen to your iPhone and you needed a new one you could just sign in with your credentials and you would have everything back in a second. I just love my iPhone so much it’s so dependable when I need it the most. I recommend trying it out at least once in your life and just see how well you’re taken care of..",0
5.0,"iPhone 7, never AGAIN","December 12, 2016",0,"Up to now you could trust a new iPhone release, without “touching” the new one. Since iPhone7 everything looks different. There is no difference now in design between iPhone 6 and iPhone7, worse the new iPhone 7 is thicker and heavier. The new innovations on iPhone7 are few and for a standard user forgettable. E.g. a professional photographer takes a SLR anyway, and a Pro Diver doesn't take his Phone to the Sea. For that reason, the loudspeaker connection is also missing and you have to carry another stupid cable. And I will never use that stupid wireless earphones. Should I stick them to my ear during running ?  I already regret that I transferred to the iPhone7. And the sh ... Home button is a horror. The whole phone vibrates like a surprise egg. IPhone7 never again, sorry Apple, maybe next time again. And then only after extensive tests of the new release.",1
5.0,Does everything very well in a nice slick package,"December 31, 2016",0,"No complaints. Does everything very well in a nice slick package. I bought mine from one of my carrier retailers stores, but it's the same unlocked version as directly from Apple or resellers. Be sure to verify 1660 for 7 or 1661 for plus. Everyone has personal preferences but most reviews are nitpicking minor stuff at this point. So no headphone jack. I was concerned about that but the reality is its no big deal. I use an audio cable in the car because I prefer real speakers to any headphones or earbuds. The battery life is finally so good that with the supplied adapter you can listen longer than you will care to drive. Or do much of anything else. The home button. I find it annoying but maybe a little less than previous versions. I had devices without one first so they always seemed a bit old fashioned to me or like a step backwards. If you've always had one I guess its like replacing your favorite blanket or teddy bear with a slightly different one. Ultimately no big deal also. Except that adding water resistance is nice. As for the tech. Its awesome. Like as good as laptops were only a few years ago. As for the spec nuts. They forget perhaps the most important ones. I'll try to explain in a way more people get. Apple's software is like a sports car. Android like an SUV. So if the ""power"" specs don't seem so impressive it doesn't matter. You don't need as much to get better performance. Also maybe an even bigger consideration is data. If you have an unlimited plan or affordable one with a large amount premium phones are nice. If not or you use wifi or home internet more or only basic features or whatever get a cheaper phone that does what you use it for. The difference can buy a nice iPad or tablet of choice and possibly still have some left over. Again just personal preference. I travel a lot and carry a Bluetooth keyboard and adaptors to use hotel TVs as monitors so no need for extra devices. I've also done it the other way and carried around several including a laptop. Let me also say I'm not knocking Android. But on that front I would advise staying away from Samsung. Over rated cheap junk with a premium price. There are much nicer for the same or less money. I always liked the Sony or Moto products for build quality and actually being good at what you want to do. I switched to Apple and was aggravated at first. Still don't have a lot nice to say about the 6+ I had before this one. But seriously the 7 is a huge improvement. And maybe the least important personal reason, man the satin black is just nice! That's from an old gear head. The people who say it's not exciting well.... Its not. They're all little flat things you hold and touch to use. What it does and how well is more exciting than the next gimmick to me. Like edges that prevent using a useful case so the first time you drop it the wrong way you need to spend hundreds more on repairs or a replacement. Just great! Where do I not sign up?",0
4.0,A Nearly Perfect Phone,"September 22, 2017",0,"To all smart phone users looking for a device that has an operating system that is simplistic, yet powerful - the iPhone 7 is the phone for you...Upon purchasing iPhone 7, users will quickly realize that the technology that has been built into in this phone makes a noticeable impact on the overall user experience. The technology used makes everyday life easier, and allows the user to utilize their time more efficiently...Impactful Technology..• 12MP camera.• A10 Fusion chip.• Touch ID..These three features give the iPhone 7 the ability to improve the ease with which the user operates the phone. The 12MP camera is great for capturing all of life’s most memorable events. The clarity and zoom capability of the camera gives the user the ability to pull out their phone and snap a photo, or take a video, in a matter of seconds. The speed at which you are able to open the camera and snap a picture can be directly related to the A10 Fusion chip that is inside the iPhone 7. This chip is the fastest processor that Apple has released, allowing the phone to operate at incredible speeds. The processor allows multitasking between various applications without any delays in output. Touch ID allows all the phones features to be accessible by simply scanning the users finger. This is a feature that is convenient and efficient...Missing Technology..• 3.5-mm stereo headphone jack..The absence of the 3.5-mm stereo headphone jack is the reason this phone is described as “nearly perfect”. In order to use headphones, they must be connected through the lightning port via a Lightning to 3.5-mm Headphone Adapter. The adapter’s small size makes it easy to misplace. Apple left out this feature in order to make the phone thinner, but this makes the phone unable to charge while playing audio through headphones...The noticeable inconvenience of this problem, however, quickly fades within a few weeks, as keeping track of the adapter becomes easier. The user will also become more conscious about charging the phone when not using headphones...As you can see, this iPhone 7 has a long list of benefits and can make a big impact on the daily life of the user. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those looking for a phone that will make day to day life simpler and more efficient...",0

The box was sealed but the screen protector looked a bit worn out. I started the phone and everything seemed to be working fine but the headphones are not supported by the phone. They also don't have that quality feel to them as do mac products. I went on line to check the serial number and it says that the 1 year warranty is over June 2018. Also the jack where the charger and headphones get plugged into is slightly dirty (not the new clean it should be). Overall, I'm not sure what else will fail since I probably got a refurbished phone. For now I'm stuck with no headphones.",1
5.0,Great phone!,"September 20, 2016",0,"Great phone overall with a very fast processor, and doesn't overheat. On my iPhone 5s, I would notice quickly that my phone would become hot, but not with the iPhone 7. I would recommend this to anyone that is trying to get the best operating system, but at the same time the fastest and most reliable phone. The only downside to this phone is that there is a cable that you have to plug into the charging port, which could wear down quicker over time.",5
1.0,Don't Buy the Hype,"October 20, 2017",0,"I bought this mistake in August after hearing all the hype about the need to have an I phone.  Big mistake.  I am now stuck with an over priced piece of crap tha for the next two year.  I would have less issues if this phone for the money included high quality material .three weeks after I bought it it slipped off the coffee table 18 inches high A ND THE SCREEN CRACKED!  I then found out their was only one Apple Store in Tucson.  Once I finally got there they want to charge 129 dollars for replacement glass.  After s few heated words turn out they realized I had insurance -- so only 29 dollars please and even though I had an appointment there would be several hours of wait time.  By the way we have fine selection an Apple labeled junk for you to look at and max your credit card out on while you wait.  I asked if they would please install the screen cover I had brought with me..  They said yes, then several hours later when I got back my repaired apple I was asked to wait another 20 minutes, then approached and told Apple does not install third party equipment, but they could sell me a protector and install it - for 39 dollars.  I left in disgust..So far the list of apps recommended for Apple aren't available,  I can't import my music, and there's no such thing as an working app.  Siri sucks.  My bar strength has gone from four bars to two if I'm Lucky. Bleck!!!  Buy and Android!.",0

5.0,The best iPhone ever,"October 24, 2016",0,"The iPhone 7 (Plus) is by far the best iPhone ever created, possibly the best phone ever created. However, because it is similar to previous iPhones, I will try to focus on whats new and whats so great about it. First the processor, its amazing, but so is the processor in just about every phone now a days. But considering this phone is more powerful then any MacBook or MacBook Air, or Even iPad ever created, its pretty remarkable...Second, and this is probably the biggest, and greatest thing about this phone, is the camera, or should I say cameras. The iPhone 7 (Plus) hands down features the best camera on a phone I have ever seen. It is really fast to focus and to fire, and images are sharp and extremely color accurate. In fact, after putting this camera through its paces, I questioned why I even owned my Canon EOS 5D Mark III. But then I remembered, BOKEH. IOS 10.1 (which I beta tested) bring ""Portrait Mode"" which works, however not always. Also its not as good as a fast lens on my full-frame body, but there is definitely room to improve the portrait mode blurred effect. Overall this is a great camera...One of the last great things about this phone is the display. When I first placed my order, I wondered if the display would live up to the claims. Wider-color gamut, 25% brighter. Well it definitely does. This is honestly one of the most color accurate displays I have ever seen, and boy does it get bright when it needs to...Finally the added 256GB storage option is much appreciated, as I am a storage hog. Also I absolutely love the Jet Black color. this reminds of my first iPhone, the iPhone 3G. There are some negatives to this phone however, it definitely ""Hisses"" for one. However unless my phone is to the Apple Logo on the phone, I can not hear it. Also, the display is slightly (very slightly) more yellow then the iPhone 6s. However after using, I pulled out my iPhone 6s Plus, and though my iPhone 6s plus display was actually more yellow...If the small hiccups bother you, return it and get a new one, or go to the genus bar for a replacement. Other wise, sit back, and enjoy the best phone ever created...I ordered an iPhone 7 Plus 256GB Jet Black T-Mobile through Apples website at launch.",1

5.0,The Pinnacle of the iPhone Experience,"October 4, 2016",0,"Design..This is the best looking iPhone yet in my mind. First off the antenna lines on the rear of the phone are moved more to the top and bottom of the phone and blend in more than they did on the iPhone 6/6S. Even better, if you have the black or jet black versions, they don’t really show up at all. Overall, it looks similar to the 6/6S, but feels like the final, evolved version of the design. The size feels great and overall, it is just a beautiful phone...As stated above, the iPhone 7 has added both black and jet black colors. They haven’t utilized a true black color since the iPhone 4/4S, and these new colors truly look so much better than the space gray of old. Also as mentioned, they almost completely hide the antenna lines which is a huge plus. My personal pick would be the jet black, but the regular black looks much better in real life than it does on the Apple website where it looks more gray than it truly is. You can also still get the phone in gold, silver, and rose gold variations...The home button is now not an actual “button,” but utilizes the 3D touch like capability to simulate the idea you are pressing a button. The settings options gives three different modes to simulate this, and after only a day, I completely got used to it. The fingerprint sensor is as fast as ever which makes unlocking your phone a consistent and seamless experience. I have faced very few occasions where my fingerprint didn't accurately register...The iPhone series has officially become waterproof! By doing this, it makes me feel so much more secure in just the day to day tasks of using my phone. If I’m caught in a rainstorm, it is reassuring to not have to tuck the phone and run like a football player. It is also dustproof and is rated IP67 which means it is certified to be resistant for up to three feet for thirty minutes...Camera..The rear camera is stronger than ever on the iPhone 7. It has an improved 12MP camera that takes excellent pictures. The regular version of the iPhone finally has OIS (optical image stabilization) just like its big brothers, the Plus series. The pictures it takes are clear, capture a great amount of light, and due to the OIS, rarely come out blurry. The camera loads lightning fast and is overall just a spectacular camera...The front camera also took another bump up to 7MP. The combination of the improved resolution, consistent retina flash (front flash), and speed are excellent on the front camera. I still wish it had a wider field of vision, but other than that, I have no complaints about the front camera...Display..The Retina display is the same as it has been since the iPhone 4. 326 pixels per inch is a good looking display. It certainly does not compete with some other phones and their higher resolution screens, but for now, the screen still gets the job done. I would like to see them improve this in the next installment, but it is still a pleasing screen to view at 4.7 inches...The brightness is outstanding and it also drops very low too, which is a benefit if you are trying to read something in a dark room. According to Apple the brightness is better than ever, but I have not noticed any discernible difference in that area...Audio..The audio is excellent. It finally has stereo speakers where sound comes out the bottom right speaker grill and the top speaker on the front of the screen. Having stereo speakers, along with a front facing one makes such a difference when listening to music or watching a video. It sounds great and just makes the listening experience so much more enjoyable.  This is certainly one of the biggest improvement areas over last year. Also, in terms of the big headphone jack controversy, it does actually come with a lightning to 3.5mm converter, so you can still use headphones with it...Battery..Battery life has improved over the 6S and SE. On daily use, I have gotten a couple more hours of use per day. I would still welcome faster charging options, but this is a nice step up from previous generations. It has increased to 1,960 mAh battery which makes a difference...Functionality..This is the pinnacle of the IOS software experience. The 2GB of RAM, the A10 processor, and the implementation of IOS 10 is great. Everything runs well and quickly. Also, the fact that the storage sizes have all doubled to 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB is fantastic, as 16GB is a very antiquated notion. Expandable storage would be welcome, but due to how IOS is more locked down and for monetary reasons, I understand why that won’t most likely be a feature in the near future...The software is clean, smooth, and works well. There are still a few pet peeves such as not being able to close all the apps down at once or not being able to make simple changes such as changing the color of text messages instead of just grey, blue, and green without jailbreaking the phone. But that is also part of its strength. Everything on the phone has been glossed to a high sheen, and almost everything runs well. IOS is simple, straightforward, and I look at it like a menu at a restaurant: it may not have the largest selection or allow you to ask for substitutions, but what you did get is mostly excellent...If you would like to read more of my reviews, please check out: smartphonehaven.com",1

The larger size was a change but after a few weeks I really like that. The one main complaint is the removal of the headphone jack. My home stereo system has a connection, but is not blue tooth enabled, which means I either no longer listen to my music on my home entertainment system, or I now have to buy a new stereo, plus now my earphones are basically worthless. Plus my truck isn't enabled either, so now I just listen on the phone.

1.0,No headphone jack?  Fail.,"April 12, 2017",0,"I've had Apple iPhone's for years, and I only own Apple computers and iPads, but I hate this iPhone7 so much I think I'll try turning it back in and getting an iPhone 6.  This is my problem: I teach fitness classes at a dozen different gyms all with different sound systems, and because the iPhone doesn't have a headphone jack, I can no longer connect to their sound system.  Yes, the iPhone came with an adapter, but that 2 inch adapter was quickly lost with all the running around that I do.  SO, I bought a dozen inexpensive adapters from China to have plenty of extras on hand (about $1 each as opposed to the Apple price of $9) but when I plug them in, they work for about 10 seconds, then they stop working with a message on my iPhone that says something like, ""This accessory is not supported.""  This whole situation has become an expensive, inconvenient mess for me.  It seems that with the new iPhone, I cannot easily charge and listen to my headphones at the same time, and that if I lose my headphone adapter I'm forced to buy the expensive iPhone brands.  Someone told me that they got rid of the headphone jacks so that people would be forced to by the blue tooth ear buds.  Apple!  This is a disaster for me, and it really does appear that you engineered this inconvenience just to sell more accessories.  How about thinking about what would be most convenient for your customers, who are paying $800 for an iPhone?",2

This makes this phone the most inconvenient &amp; biggest waste of money..Up till when I got this phone I was an avid Apple supporter, however they lost this customer not only with this product bug also with the lack of  this company's integrity.

1.0,Generalized 7 Review,"May 19, 2017",0,"I have owned strictly androids, until I was forced into an iPhone for work. I have had a 5, 6s plus, and now, the 7. When I got so mad at the poor functionality of the 6, and after smashing and breaking it, i got the 7, thinking it was a superior phone. Well, compared even to the 6, and the horrible LG line up that they've had their entire time as a smart phone manufacturer, the 7 is literally a pile of garbage...Here is what is right with it:.- The camera. It works. The 6 was better...That's it. Here's what's wrong with it:.- Freezes randomly in the middle of a task.- Randomly closes me out of apps.- Not smooth, fluid functionality.- Voice to text is laughably worse than Android. Before the latest iOS update, that was one of the only things I preferred about the iPhone over an Android. Now, apple has nothing..- Maps is a joke.- The home button is also a joke. In order to do a reset, you have to hold the power and volume down key, which in turn turns your volume down. Because that couldn't be programmed to operate differently..- Who needs a headphone jack? Not the 7, apparently. Now you have to buy a separate $25 piece to listen to music..- Overall cheap feel..- Autocorrect. What? You typed ""of""? You obviously meant ""if""...I could go on and on about how terrible this phone is. But, I think you get it. I have put in a request at work to get back into a 6, because of how terrible this phone is. Out of the nearly two dozen phones I've owned over my lifetime, this stands at my number one spot for worst phone available to major providers over the last 15 years. I have also been to the three major providers (Tmobile, att, and Verizon), and have had a huge array of different kinds of phones. I say with confidence, that this is the worst phone I have ever had the stress, and displeasure of using...Buy at your own risk. These phones are terrible.",3

1.0,NOT FOR AUDIO PHILES,"April 20, 2017",0,"The fact that I have to use one an adapter just to use normal headphone is so stupid it makes my eyes bleed. I really used to love apple, but this whole ""taking out the audio jack"" thing is the dumbest move they have ever made. The original adapter that came with my iPhone 7 crapped out after only a couple months. So now I have to buy another one (and I'm assuming yet another one after this one breaks) when they should have just kept the audio jack in the first place...Also if you go anywhere and want to plug in your phone without using bluetooth, you have to carry around an adapter with you...WTF? Bluetooth can be a pain in the ass and not every sound system has it. Wireless headphones are garbage especially for any type of vigorous exercise...That's not even the worst part...not being able to charge the phone while having music playing is mind boggling annoying. Especially since I'm a musician and use a lot of music apps, this just adds to my frustration and difficulties when syncing midi devices and performing. You can get more adapters for these things but that just leads to a weird tangle of wires all of which are prone to failure...If you give a crap about audio, seriously reconsider buying an iPhone 7. And these adapters straight up suck..",0

It did this repeatedly for about six months...After about six months, it stopped erasing my whole library, but instead, the titles of songs were replaced with random numbers...About a month ago, my phone started randomly shutting off or restarting. Also, the phone's home button randomly stopped working, but after about an hour would begin working again...As I write this review, am attempting to restore my phone to factory settings for the second time today, because it will not stop restarting......",1

1.0,This phone is NOT waterproof nor water resistant. Best of luck if it's splashed as well,"April 24, 2017",0,"This phone is NOT waterproof nor water resistant and I would be very hesitant to say, like every other iphone model, it’s not splash resistant either. There is also nothing the iphone employees can do, while they are polite, the consensus felt like, we are Apple and while we advertise the phone is splash and water resistant if you get water near this phone tough luck, we are the trendy, hip phone and people will keep buying us..My experience: I purchased the new iPhone 7 while traveling as it advertised a better camera and as long as I was careful it would do well against water as I was in SE Asia and humidity was an issue with my iPhone 6. I had the phone for 3 weeks, put it in my dry bag after taking some photos, pulled it out and it never turned on again. My bag was dry on the inside, the phone had no visible splashes or water on it. It was hot and I had no idea what was wrong with it as it had no water on it or in the bag. I found out later it somehow got water inside I can only imagine from humidity which is only an issue I’ve had with Apple products, now twice..I was in the Philippines at the time and took the phone to the local iservice store in Cebu. They told me there was nothing I could do and to call the customer hotline. Since my phone was broken I had to borrow the phone at a pizza restaurant. It was midafternoon on a Monday, I mention this because it took approximately 1.5-2 hours on hold prior to talking with a customer agent. She said there was nothing I could do since I was not in the country the phone was made (US) and basically, I needed to get to a western country to have it serviced. Since I needed a phone while I was traveling I requested to escalate the issue, I was passed on to another higher agent that again said there is nothing I can do after 2 more hours on hold..For three months I held on to the phone hoping I would get better service once I arrived home or in Europe where I would be staying indefinitely. In Europe they took the phone apart and concluded it had water damage. Now I understand there is no way Apple can know what happen and after insisting to 3 employees and a manager that there was no water damage I was told there is nothing that can be done with the warranty and that I could replace the phone for ~400 Euros. They mentioned it had corrosion, which made sense since it somehow got water inside, while in a dry bag and I had to spend the next three months trying to find an iPhone store….Moving forward I will purchase Samsung products. In my experience iPhones are overpriced, overhyped, made out of glass and have years of testing to go before they advertise as water or splash resistant. Unfortunately the service is also poor because they’ve built such a strong brand. Hopefully there is somewhere I can donate a $800 three week old piece of garbage....",0

Size is just right for me - the iPhone plus is too big. So is the Note 7..- iMessages is fun and fast.- Siri is better with the faster chip..Camera is better, of course.

4.0,A nice phone overall,"October 15, 2016",0,"The iPhone7 is a very nice phone overall. Most of all, it got better speakers from the iPhone6s, thanks to the missing headphone; however, when charging the battery, we can't listen to music, which could be disadvantageous. As for the battery, iPhone 7 features 14% larger battery compared to iPhone 6, but the battery dropped 40% when all I do is listen to music for an hour, which I think could be because the engine fast and quick, so it affects the battery life. Regarding the camera, the quality is amazing, and it's 1.5 times clearer and the zoom is better than before. As for the sensitivity of the screen, I felt inconvenient when I swipe left or right because the screen didn't move sometimes. Especially, when I used iCloud Drive, the screen was stuck in the iCloud Drive a few times, so this is nonsense for one of the greatest smart phones. Most of all, I like the 3D touch action, and the solid-state homebutten. Therefore, on a scale of 1-4. I'll give 4 stars because I think they just have to work on the sensitivity of the screen and battery life; however, I like the design, a nice camera, a fast engine, and the 3D touch action.",1

I use my phone for calls almost the entire day. I listen to music and take calls in mu phone and comouter all the time...This means bluetooth is not good. I don't need the radiation, the constant recharging baby sitting, and the cumbersome dongle to charge the phone while using a wired headset. I also have a car without bluetooth, that has an rj plug. The best quality is using the jack. This is a high end stereo speaker, and I have tried bluetooth adapters, and it sounds really awful...My famility has had to replace broken glasses so many times too. The more they make it fancy, the easiest to get them to crack. Since everything is getting integrated, a glass crack means replacing a very expensive screen now (this started with 6S line)...I will skip iPhone 7, and have already had my wife tell me she doesn't want it either...I can't rate this phone more than 2 stars. The iPhone 6S gets 3 (due to the screen), the 4S would get 5 (but it's too slow now) and this last phone gets a 2: a hassle to me, overpriced, and requires extra insurance (screen) while being to fragile and thin making the battery small so it can't last me a single day, making the thin phone turn into clumsy one that needs a case...Apple can build products, and make decisions. I can skip those products. But when you make an ecosystem, where switching is very hard, and start taking away choices without consulting, you are abusing your user base...Is this a bad phone? No. But it's much worst than 6S to me, and its predecessors. And compared to them, it's a 3, and one star is taking by the horrendous cross sell that is happening in the AppStore (i don't care one bit iPhone App has an iWatch App, stop telling me: you already know I have no iEatch registered with you). They are also responsible for bringing casinos into into childs lives and those that can't refrain, through the In App purchase model. I am discouting 1 star for that, and retroactively to all other phones as well...The iPhone is still my prefered choice.

4.0,iPhone 7 review,"September 23, 2016",0,"iPhone 7.Each year, Apple Inc. launches a better version of the iPhone into the market. I agree, the iPhone 7 is the highest preforming smartphone in the market to date. The A10 Fusion chip, whose function is to power the iPhone 7, is comprised of four distinct cores: two low-energy cores designed for easier tasks while ensuring low power usage and two high-performance cores to handle the most intense tasks. When testing my iPhone 7, I noticed that it had an internal storage of 128GB and the speed of some personal computers. The phone is ideal for university students who are always on the go and store everything on their phones. This is a pretty big deal since one of the biggest issues with the iPhone's was storage..Design.The iPhone 7 has an elegant new design that comes in five finishes, silver, gold, rose gold, black, and jet black. The black finish is characterized by an anodized matte look.  The jet black finish is consummated through anodization and innovative polish, perfecting its glossy finish. An exclusively and perfectly reengineered enclosure makes the phone water resistant while offering maximum protection against dust, spills, or even splashes..Screen.The iPhone 7 screen is more improved as compared to iPhone 6s, which makes it comfortable for the user even in the harsh midday glare. For instance, I can comfortably read an article in the sunlight using my phone. Also, the screen is capable of supporting a wider gamut of color, making videos, as well as photos to pop with saturated and vivacious hue..Apps.Launching Apps on the iPhone 7 is quicker than other Smartphones. Its processor works very fast and is capable of running high graphic games and supporting convoluted photo-editing applications. The iPhone's battery is capable of lasting longer than a day when used normally..Camera.The iPhone 7 is built with a single 12-megapixel iSight camera whose performance is incomparable to that of the iPhone 6s. The aperture lens of this phone is wider, f1.8, allowing penetration of more light, making it possible to take better photos in the dark or low-light. The iPhone 7 is comprised of an optical image stabilizer that was initially limited to only superior Plus Smartphone models.  Also, the phone has a TrueTone flash which is brighter when compared to that of iPhone 6s. The color of the photos is remarkable on the iPhone 7 due to the P3 color gamut. Its distinctive features, such as the iOS 10 can allow a third-party application to effectively access RAW data from its iSight camera. All these features put the iPhone 7 at the top of the list when it comes to smartphones..",12

Each phone's ringtone and any clicking sound stop working after about 2 years of use. No damage caused by me at all. When I called Apple they said it's out of warranty and it would cost about $300 to replace or repair the phone. This happened for both iphone. I read the book Steve Jobs and I realized Apple's strategy is to integrate everything and hard to repair them. I think they don't care about customer's burden for repair. I am definitely switching to Galaxy for my next smart phone. Strongly recommend not to use iphone.,0

I would prefer not suffering third degree burns when simply charging your device.

So it looks like apple has a great opportunity here to win back consumers after the 6S failed to captivate the market place. The Iphone 7 is a stunning phone visually. I picked the jet black version as apple has done a nice job here with color design. Going back the design of the phone as we all know the headphone jack has been removed. I do own the apple earpods which work with this bluetooth like technology or whatever and connecting them has been a breeze and so was wearing them for an extended period of time. But still this integration is not perfect. I spent over 100 dollars on wired beats last year and now they cannot be used easily without spending even more money which I refuse to do. Also I do fear I may lose these earphones as they are quite small and can get lost within a backpack it looks like. I have no ideal how the market will react to this change but we will find out. You definitely can adapt to this major design change if you want to. All your volume buttons and power buttons appear to be in the same spot.

Apple has added a few features to the phone such as the vibrating home button, a better camera with 14 mega pixels for the back and 7 mega pixels for the front. With not much change in the phone design but a few, apple stepped up with the software up date adding new texting feature and just giving the phone a new look software wise. But honestly when it comes down to it, the 7 is similar to the 6 in multiple ways and this makes me wish that apple would of done a better job at redesigning the new iPhone. I would recommend apple to anyone due to the dependability of their phones but keep in mind that with new releases of this phone might bring some disappointment.",0

Samung galaxy s7.2. Iphone 7.I checked every forum on the internet and it was really hard for me to make this decision really . Mostly i appreciate phones specifications and the only thing in which samsung was better was the screen resolution ( i dont really need 2k display -_-) and camera which needs some kind of knowledge to take good pictures but iphone is more like easier..I did not buy iphone 7 plus because it is far too big for me and my pocket ..I like phone itself but ios system is not comfortable for me , because android has way too much freedom , but i won't write less than 5 stars because of my tastes about ios system..PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY GOT IPHONE 6 or 6 PLUS IF YOU REALLY BUY PHONE FOR ITS SPECIFICATIONS OR FEATURES DON't UPGRADE , I HAD A LOT OF TIME WITH IPHONE 6 AND THERE IS WAY TOO SMALL AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCES...PERSONALLY I THINK THAT NOBODY SHOULD UPGRADE PHONE EVERY YEAR OR 2 TIMES PER YEAR. AIN'T NO COMPANY UPGRADES THEIR GADGETS 1-2 TIMES PER YEAR SO THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY NEED UPGRADE SINCE PREVIOUS VERSION OF IT. WAIT 1-2 YEAR AND THEN GO UPGRADE..UPDATE ###1 : i get used to it, phone works perfectly and seems very fast. I like it and maybe i won't change it :).....",6

Just to take note. Some users also reported of bloating batteries but that may be just some isolated cases. Software wise (at the time of writing) is optimised with occasional glitches and bugs.
