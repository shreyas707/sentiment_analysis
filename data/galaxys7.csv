1.0,"BEWARE, I got a freaking FAKE phone.","July 12, 2016",1,"I bought this phone from Amazon.com LLC (no some marketplace store).  I payed $680..AND, When I opened the box the phone looked cheap and fake, but when I opened the battery box, I realized that I GOT A FAKE PHONE..The box seemed legit, but seriously the phone only a shell and inside only had a piece of metal to give it some weight..Amazon is going to do a replacement but how can this possibly happen?.Unbelievable!  A F@#$@#ing FAKE phone.",263
5.0,Best Phone currently on the Market - Includes International Version Details,"March 30, 2016",1,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935F in Black from this product page a week ago...A lot of people have asked questions about this particular international version so I'll answer some of those first. For starters, the one I got was the english edition for the Saudi Arabia market (see attached photos, the guides came in english and arabic). From what I can tell, the phone is the same as any other international edition but with different preinstalled apps. Mine came with a SA region specific app ""Shaid"" (seems to be a YouTube-esque app in arabic) that I uninstalled and WhatsApp. Other than that the only remaining bloatware was stock Samsung apps (no carrier apps, thank god), the only other thing I noticed that may be region specific is the S Planner app has a ""Hijri dates adjustment"" setting. Lastly this version ships with a non-us wall charger (aside from the regular stock accessories) shown in my review images. Mine also came with an adapter for use within the U.S., I have tried it and can confirm that it works with fast charging...This phone also uses a different chipset (manufactured by Samsung, called Exynos 8890) than the U.S. version. Reviews I read noted that the phone was actually optimized for this chipset w/ better performance and battery life than the U.S. Qualcomm counterpart (Google it). In the U.S. version the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip is used to support Verizon and Sprint customers whereas this version only supports GSM carriers...To preface the review of the actual use of the phone, I have owned the following devices and used them each as a daily driver for at least a months time: Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE, Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, HTC One M8 GPE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been the most delightful experience of the bunch. I won't go into great detail here but the camera is phenomenal and launches faster than any other phone I've owned w/ a double tap of the home button. The camera's auto focus is super fast and I feel like I'm able to get a capture a lot of moments that my previous phones were too slow to shoot. It's also nice to be able to change the quick launch apps on the lock screen, I have the dialer and snapchat as mine...Continuing a theme of high performance this phone is incredibly fast despite powering a QHD resolution screen. Apps are surprisingly quick to load and multitasking is a breeze (I even found some use in the Samsung's split screen feature). The fingerprint scanner is on par with apple devices (and nexus 6p/5x) although because of it's non-circular shape I find that I place my finger the wrong way more often. The battery is the best of any device I've used as a daily driver, I've been able to get through days of heavy usage like today (unplugged from charger at 5:45am, now at 25% at 9:03pm)...The screen is BEAUTIFUL. Not only is it easy to read even in direct sunlight (something I have seen other devices struggle with) but the colors are vibrant and the screen is huge without making the phone too big or bulky. Perfect for watching YouTube videos and browsing instagram...Lastly a few notes if you buy this phone:.- If you're not a fan of the stock Samsung launcher you can get the Google Now launcher from the Play Store, it's the same one used on Nexus devices and feels smoother than Samsung's launcher..- This time around Samsung decided to give you bigger icons which drove me nuts, search for ""Get more on your Galaxy S7, S6 or Note 5 screen with hidden DPI scaling settings"" from Android authority to get a 5th column on the home screen and smaller UI elements..- ""Edge functionality"" is just okay. The feature feels a bit less than polished because of the weak offerings in the Samsung app store - I have it turned off...Edit 4/8/2016: sorry about the quality of the photos of the actual phone - they were shot with the wide angle lens of my GoPro whereas the other images were shot with the S7 Edge...Edit 4/10/2016: added some higher quality images from my new camera...Update 5/9/2016: I've been using the phone as a daily driver for over a month now. I'm still impressed by the overall gfx smoothness, how fast apps load, and camera performance...Update 7/25/2016: still in love with this phone. I'm honestly not sure what would compel me to purchase a new phone at this point.. I also rooted the phone and changed the emojis to the iOS 9 set with the Emoji Switcher app from the play store. No more guessing when messaging my iOS friends =)..A lot of commenters have asked which seller I purchased mine from: Wireless Everything..",578
1.0,I bought the phone in April 2016 and worked perfect until October of that year when it started to ...,"January 26, 2017",1,"I bought the phone in April 2016 and worked perfect until October of that year when it started to restart itself and every time, and VERY HOT. There are days when I just can not use it and many others work fine. I contacted Amazon and they told me that it was out of the 30 day warranty but that IÂ¨ll should go to a Samsun Center for the 1 year warranty. I did it and as I live in Ecuador, South America, I took it to the authorized center and they told me that the problem should be that it has to be update, it but they could not do it because the phone is from Egypt !! And that only in the place of origin it can be done!!.So when they buy a phone notice of which zone it is..Sold by: Wireless Place...Now in March 2017 the  cell phone stopped working. For having been bought on Amazon it  had no Samsung warranty and as the damage occurred after the first 3 months, Amazon also did not take responsibility. I lost the $ 750 that it cost me before a year of use..I will never bought a mobile phone in Amazon again..",103
1.0,Fine Print Fiasco,"August 19, 2016",1,"I purchased this phone for the expressed purpose of developing VR projects for Gear VR and Google Cardboard. I never expected or intended to use the phone features of the device. So I never added a SIM card much less carried it around or away from my office. After a couple of weeks the OS seemed to have crapped out and got itself stuck on some green terminal looking boot screen. Despite all my attempts to force a restart, perform a system restore, drain/charge the battery or whatever Android lets you do by holding in button X while closing one eye and whistling a happy tune, the phone just won't get past that Bootloader exception screen...I'm not an Android guy and since the purpose of the phone was to test apps, the device was required to be as close to stock as possible to adequately replicate the experience someone might have on their own device. By that I mean I didn't ""root"" the phone or mess with the OS beyond letting Android run all those auto updates it seems to do on a daily basis...I contacted Samsung US support and they said my phone didn't exist as far as they were concerned because it was obviously an international device. They told me to determine the country of origin and arrange service there...How convenient...I looked for some type of local resource that can service phones but it appears all that can be done are screen or battery replacements. Anything heavier has to go to the manufacturer...in Spain...or Antartica...or the Moon...I contacted the Amazon Marketplace vendor (Mobiles International LLC) that I purchased the phone from and they we nice enough in their correspondence and said:..""Unfortunately Samsung does not provide warranty service on international unlocked phones. If you sent it to us in Miami, we can get a quote from a Samsung authorized service center to get the phone repaired. It looks like a software issue and should be fixable.""..I FedEx'd them the phone and waited and waited. After two weeks or so I sent them an email wondering if there was any update...""At this time we have not received a quote unfortunately, the Samsung repair center here cannot repair your device because it is not Latin. We have one other option that we are trying. We will contact you as soon as we get a response.""..And waited and waited...till about a month and half had passed and got this:..""We received the unit back from Samsung this week. They returned the unit saying the warranty was void. We have shipped back to your address yesterday.""..Huh? Is Samsung saying that I dropped it in a toilet? Or that I used my considerable phone hacking skills to circumvent their awesome software and install my own custom OS? No idea...So the lesson being, read the fine print. International unlocked phones may or may NOT come with a warranty. And even if you work yourself past that little detail and decide to roll the dice...if something goes wrong with your device there appears to be no recourse to have it repaired...Even if you expect to pay for said repair because the assumption being that a repair would cost less than the cost of a new phone there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to facilitate getting it fixed. Waiting weeks and weeks to get some vague note about the warranty being void is hardly a workable solution..",369
1.0,"Be aware, scam","April 13, 2016",1,This phone is a mess. I used to love the first months but now I don't have any signal( I tried 3 conpanies already) and is heaing up and freezing and starting the phone. Also my fingerprins don't work.

1.0,Never Again...,"January 12, 2017",1,Do not trust this provider. I payed for a brand new S7 Edge and I ended up recieving a S6 Edge along with a charger that looks like it's been through a war in some third world country,24

4.0,What are my thoughts of this phone now that I have owned it for three months?,"January 7, 2017",1,"This review is not about the performance of the phone itself, which you can check online with many reputable phone reviewers. This review is about my experience in buying an international version through this seller as opposed to through a carrier as most mobile phone consumers do in the US. Now that I have a chance to use it for close to three months, I can say that it is safe to buy this phone as I had doubt before buying it. It is an international version sold in Asian countries and works as advertised. I love it because it supports dual SIMs and is in gold color, both of which are not available in the US market where I live. The phone works just like any new Samsung Galaxy phone thus far and I am impressed with Samsung's quality. Just so you know, I had the Note 7 prior to this phone and no phone can beat the Note 7, so it was a shame that it was recalled...Here is the summary of my review for this international version of the Galaxy S7 Edge:.Pros:.- Same quality as the US versions.- Unlocked (can be used with any GSM carriers).- Dual SIMs support (or 1 SIM 1 micro flash memory).- Much cheaper then its US counterparts..Cons:.- No warranty (this is a gamble you would have to take). Samsung US will not help you if you ran into issues.- The seal of the box was broken, but nothing seems to have been missing. Not sure why that is.- The charger's plug is not compatible with the US outlets, you will need to get an adapter. I thought his version uses the the US style but I was wrong.....",2
1.0,"Be Aware, its beautiful while last but no warranty, Samsung or Mobiles International (seller) dont take responsibility from sale","June 20, 2017",1,"After 9 months cellphone broke, I am very meticulous and careful about the use and care of electronics, I got this cellphone brand new ($650.00), one day completely stop working, screen gets light up in intense white until consumes all battery, gets really hot during that. I am unable to make it work or reset in any way. I have lost all my media content, Apps, and contacts. I email Seller âMobiles Internationalâ, their answer was "" am sorry to inform you that your phone is almost 9 months out of our 30 day replacement period and it was not sold with any manufacturer warranty. Please take your phone to a local cellular repair center for testingâ. On the other hand Samsung USA is not responsible for guarantee that phone, suggest take it for repair and pay out of pocket. I email and escalate the situation direct to their absolute help center at with no any success, as Samsung is not responsible even when they can see phone was made by them. Sad that no one seems to care about to help with the issue, but at moment of purchase you get so much hype about how wonderful the product and warranty is, in this case I enjoy this phone for $2.40 per day. I own Apple products and when you have any trouble with them even without buying any extra warranty they replace any product that has malfunction, I will switch all my products there.",2
1.0,Don't expect warranty from this seller,"June 15, 2017",1,"Nice product until you need warranty from this seller. After 11 months my phone shows black horizontal lines on the screen.

Seller tells me: ""You can send it to Samsung international 1 year limited warranty repair, to find out where to send the phone to, you can find the country origin from the phone, or the phone box, and then check the warranty information from Samsung official sites"".

My Galaxy 5-5-6 are in the hands of my wife and kids and run as good as the day of original purchase. Now for my 7 Edge is the easiest to set-up and the feel and ease of use is totally incredible. It's making my laptop obsolete. I pay my bills and make all my eBay and Amazon purchases using my cellphone. S7 has so many features its insane. I'll continue to use the S7 until the S9 comes along.

Trust me if the battery was charged 100% with in no time it starts loosing its juice even if you dont talk or browse or watch movies or listen to music...These are quite a few issue i can say.

I'm still learning some of the little tricks that come with it. The cell coverage shows ""4G"", not ""4GLTE"". I don't know the difference. The ATT guy said some would say it was better, LOL. I have no idea but, whatever. There are a few pre-installed samsung/google things. Smart Switch uploaded many things, but some things like ringtones were not backed up. I had to go looking for them. In the process, I also discovered some new ones. Battery is doing just fine and lasts as expected. It has it's own Samsung factory warranty - 1 year. I haven't been able to find any way to tell for sure if this is the snapdragon or xynos processor, but as I stated earlier, the model number matches, so....my first experience with an unlocked phone purchase on Amazon has gone well, IMHO. Thus far.",3

4.0,"Just terrible experience with Samsung, but excellent one with Amazon, which reimbursed in full 6 month after purchase","December 26, 2016",1,"Just terrible experience with this. In a couple of months USB slot stopped working, so I could only charge it wirelessly. Then the device started warming up sometimes to a point it was difficult to hold it in your hand, and then going into restart cycles. I contacted the seller and was told they only provide 30 days return policy, which is reasonable. What I was shocked about is when I contacted Samsung support I was told they can't help me with an international version and I have to contact the seller. They basically refused to be liable for the product they manufactured. I had to buy another phone and have a useless piece of technology worth $600 at home, don't know what to do with it. Will probably have to throw it away eventually. The repair shops say to get to the USB slot they have to remove the screen which according to Samsung manual can't be removed without damaging it, so they give me 50/50 chance they can remove it without cracking. But since now it's completely unusable may be I could give it a try...Update: After a short chat with Amazon six months after I purchased this item, I was reimbursed in full. Reimbursement was provided by Amazon, which in fact had little to do with this situation, since it was an independent seller and initially there were clear warnings it was an international version without warranty. 8 stars to Amazon and 0 to Samsung, which gives 4 on the average....",11

One big plus I noticed is network connection speed, on my previous phone, a Xperia Z3+ it was ok but could have been better, and I thought it was just my general location and the fact I am on Cricket which piggybacks on AT&amp;T.; With the S7 Edge connection is noticeably quicker and using a speed test app my download speeds are consistently @ 7-8Mbps with even just 1 bar signal 4G LTE, Crickets' throttled limit. Signal reception is also stronger on the S7 Edge in my home than any phone I have had before and I have had quite a few, (H+ and 4G LTE)..  It is physically smaller than an iPhone 6s Plus I tried for a short period but it has the same display size, and It's a lot easier to operate 1 handed the the large iPhone..  So far, (after 10 days of heavy use), I like it better every day as it keeps on performing even as I install and use my many apps. The Nougat upgrade has been available for a few days already and I will be upgrading it soon. I will update my review after upgrading to Nougat...**Update** I installed the Nougat update yesterday, (02-21-17). No issues installing, I just let it do it's thing and it took probably 20-30min. Everything works as it should and it has lots of new features, still discovering some of them. No issues so far. I would say it is as fast and smooth as it was before the update if not better.  I'm really liking the blue light filter option to reduce eye strain. This phone is still performing and I still like it better than the day I got it!..",3

Beats iPhone 6s with ease..Edge Display with AMOLED screen is beautiful..Glass design on front and back is good but is not meant for clumsy hands or oily fingers. With a good protective case (which sort of kills the overall look of the phone) the issue of shattering the glass and fingerprint smudges is taken care of to a certain extend..All in all, I am happy that I bought this over OnePlus 3t. I am not saying latter is not a good phone; I am sure it must be great, but for me Samsung proved above and beyond my expectations. No complaints so far..",1

Only calls, messaging, camera and sometimes internet.  It started heating, I took this for normal till it was so hot that I could not even hold it, and the system would crash.  I tried several times by resetting it to factory standards, but all the same it would keep on heating and crashing.  All this happened in 3 months. I finally contacted Samsung in US during December and they told me that it is an International version, thus they could not offer warranty.  I tried to return it to Amazon Wireless and they said they would not take it back because this was after the one month period, and said the manufacturer should offer the warranty.  Conclusion:  I paid $ 617 for an fantastic smart phone which only lasted four months and during which I have only had problems.  Neither Samsung nor Amazon has offered me a refund.

(It only permits download of american model firmware from usa IP address)...Next I tried Samsung smart switch tool (which is hardly smart actually). The tool itself says cant flash because can not reach site - which site no one knows - and yes the mac is properly connected to the internet...The only way to get it to work is to get into master boot mode - and do a factory reset.  but that will only work as long as you prevent it from applying updates (i think it updates with incompatible american version software)...Big mistake.

5.0,Quite Simply The Best Phone I've Ever Owned,"August 31, 2016",1,"I live in the UK, but had this delivered to a friend's address while I completed a road trip from Miami to San Francisco.  The delivered product was well packaged and was originally intended for the Middle East market.  A big bonus for me is that the supplied charger uses a UK-style 3-pin plug.  While hardly a big deal as I, like most people, have the world's supply of USB power adapters.  Considering that this purchase has saved me quite a bit of cash over outright purchase in the UK, I'm very happy...Powering up the phone for the first time shows a single application for the intended market which was deleted as I have no use for it.  I've owned Android phones previously, but have been using an iPhone 6 Plus for the last year.  I've since fallen out of love with iOS as it's just too inflexible and is becoming somewhat childish in terms of interface.  Samsung's implementation of the Android platform is smooth, highly-polished and commendable.  It's not as fast as the pure product in the Nexus lineup, but does not suffer as all as a result...The octacore processor in the non-US model is just pure sweeping power.  It's a good thing that the battery is a hefty 3500mAh unit or it wouldn't last the day.  That said, if you're the kind of user who has multiple applications running all day long - and I'm among that userbase - this phone will take it all in its stride and not break a sweat.  The screen is absolutely beautiful without being too highly saturated, the cameras (both front and back) are immensely capable and the return of expandable storage through cheap and capacious micro-SD cards is very welcome...Physically, the phone is svelte, lightweight and sits in the hand beautifully.  Even without a case, there's no feeling that you'll drop it at any moment.  One of the finest physical features is the waterproofing that doesn't require that you slap chunks of rubber into the ports to maintain its integrity.  no more panics when you're caught in that torrential downpour about your phone suffering a premature demise...I haven't tried any of the included accessories such as the micro-USB cable, charger or earbuds as I already have very high quality 3rd-party versions.  From the look of them, they appear to be reasonable quality...For anyone in the US who's concerned about losing out on network connectivity by using a phone from an overseas market, rest assured.  I used a SIM card linked to T-Mobile's 4G network and had absolutely no issue anywhere with obtaining a good strong 4G signal.  The Exynos processor in the US market model, while likely perfectly adequate, will almost certainly be that touch slower than the beast in the overseas market product...If you're like me, fear running out of power when you're away out all day and carry a power bank, know that the quick charge 2 feature has this from about 5% to fully charged in around an hour.  The genuine Samsung quick charge puck may be slower to re-add the juice, but it's utterly convenient when you're a tired and then don't have to worry about not quite plugging the phone in to charge...If you're seeking to buy a phone without the burden of a contract, do yourself a big favour:  Save some money, get this model, use one of the probably five or six wall chargers you already have and enjoy this incredible handset.  It may be coming from outside of the US, but it's delivered quickly and I have no doubt whatsoever that it'll be loved every bit as I love mine.  This is the best phone I've ever had, and the added bonus of saving on the cost of purchasing outright through Best Buy, etc is the icing on an already very delicious cake...",2

Both had a direct update from Samsung to Android 7.0 that had to be downloaded, and installed.  On Wifi the download was very quick, and it was all done and installed in less than 30 minutes.  Gorgeous phone with glass front and back, and while my husband finds the edge apps annoying i love them.  I think its just the way he holds the phone.  We both love the battery life.  He is into an online only game, and now he can play through his 4 accounts and still has over 65% battery life left and that is going on them multiple times a day.  I have my wifi and data on all the time, and my phone has serious use through the day, and i have usually about 45% battery life left at the end of the day...We purchased the actual Samsung portable chargers for this, the little circles you just lay your phone on, and don't have to plug in the mini usb cord.

5.0,Awesome Phone!!,"September 17, 2016",1,"I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version..I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures..I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast..I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all..My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that..I will update my review in the future if anything changes...UPDATE:.I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use..I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive..I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive..I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges..Overall I would definitely recommend this phone.....",1

I purchase this phone in July and when I returned home and start using the phone overheated and burnt the screen. I payee 400 USD to get it fixed and it still haven't fix properly and all Amazon did was sent me $150 for my troubles! I had a loss. I'm out of the country and not returning until May. My business with Amazon with Electronics are DONE! Even after fix there are two shades of light in the phone and the technician said it's a software problem. He said  I should contact Samsung.  I just gave up on everything.,8

But be aware of the following caveats that come in addition to the seller's fine print in the description: Samsung Pay will most likely NOT work out the box*, you won't get WiFi calling or voice over LTE,  and also this version of the phone doesn't support the latest and greatest wireless protocol (4x4 MIMO which T-Mobile has deployed), though it's still pretty fast...*Samsung Pay can be side loaded on certain international versions depending on the original market they were intended for, such as Germany, Spain, or the UAE. There's no guarantee your phone will be from any of those regions. Mine was from Trinidad/South America...",0

5.0,"Great phone, Seller was just fine!","August 1, 2016",1,"This phone is by far one of the best on the market. After reading the reviews left by some of the buyers, there seems to be some confusion on what seller to buy it from. My phone, which is real, and came factory sealed, was bought from ""The Coos"". However, to my understanding, there is no one out there making fake edge phones. The phone is just too complex to duplicate. What might be happening is the phones could possibly be getting damaged during the shipping process. The phone is glass, so if the shipper isn't packaging it correctly, it could absolutely take on damage. This is why I recommend, that if you are planning on buying this phone from amazon, make sure amazon is the one fulfilling the order. I have had no problems at all when I order from a third party that allows amazon to fulfill the order. Also, it doesn't hurt to review the customer reviews on the actual seller as well..As far as the phone itself goes, it works perfectly. All the specs pretty much define what to expect from the phone. It's got the best screen in the world and the best camera. The glass finish makes it beautiful, but it's fingerprint prone and and extremely slippery. Other than that, I have no complaints..",7

2.0,No Samsung Pay on International model,"August 5, 2016",1,"EDIT: So after owning this for a few months, I'm dropping the rating solely because of the Edge touch screen. The fact is that I find it very annoying to use. The side of your hand touches it really easily, and it it makes typing or playing games on the phone very frustrating. The edge apps themselves are very few and far between and not that useful either. It's a pity since the phone itself is great, runs programs well, has great visuals and camera but actually using the thing is just frustrating. I'd suggest getting just the S7 to save yourself some money and comfort...The phone that arrived is the genuine article and works great--I'm thrilled with how well the battery and fast charging works even when playing Pokemon Go all the time. Also, I have T-Mobile and the phone works perfectly fine...However, even though the app is on your phone, the international model is not compatible with Samsung Pay. If you want that you need to get the American version of the phone. I wish I'd known this, but to me it was worth the savings in price and you can still use Android Pay. But I didn't realize this before buying it and I would have liked to have known.....",1
