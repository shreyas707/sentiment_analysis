5.0,A mostly positive and detailed review.,"August 6, 2017",1,"BEWARE!.99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION!..After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)..Pro's:.1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone..2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8).3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it..4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it..5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple..6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here..7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone..8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour..9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+..10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds..11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone..12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers..13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets...Neutral:.1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions..2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect..3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it..4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it..5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs..6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read...Con's:.1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness..2. ""Ok Google"". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change..3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood)..4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button...On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know...As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot!..Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways...Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading.","1,623"
5.0,So far the best phone I ever had,"August 29, 2017",1,"<div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-R2WZC5YWPVPEWB""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1zegBnFbbS.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91TjXuWgH5S.png""/> So far the best phone I ever had. Man it's beautiful. Sleek design and powerful hardware. I did a comparison with my old phone and you certainly can feel that it's more powerful. I'm not used to it yet. But it does everything perfectly. The picture quality is superb. I love shooting video and it nails it in video quality and it does slow motion!! say whaaaat!! But sometimes it overheats under the direct sun when I record video but I think that is normal. I don't use the fingerprint sensor only because I can't find it. And the mono speaker under the phone is a downside which most of the time I cover it with my little finger and it's kinda annoying. Other than that it's freaking fast and top notch phone. I don't regret buying it ..Make sure to check out the video and pictures and if my review was helpful please press YES for helpful. Thank you.",234
5.0,"Great phone, activate yourself","August 28, 2017",1,"I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network.  My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  It takes just 5-10 minutes.  Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  Other than that the actual phone is great.  Very sleek looking phone.  This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.",94
3.0,"Gorgeous hardware, same old Sammy.","August 1, 2017",1,"This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one...Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions...",172
4.0,"As of this Review, this is the best phone on the Market","August 18, 2017",1,"I haven't owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus..I've always felt that Samsung's Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish...This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20..I really liked the LG V20 for it's cameras and the Axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3T.were so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8...I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me..The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands..I don't think I will go back to a 6"" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too...Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled..I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc...Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can't go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I'm using Face Unlock, it's really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven't tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock..They should move the camera to the corner like some phones...USB-C is awesome..Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though)...I have a few gripes..Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos..My other gripe is the single speaker. C'mon... it's 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers..Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist...By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it...This phone has tons of other features too, but I'm not going to list them all. Overall, it's the best smart phone I've ever owned. Hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years..",44
5.0,"It Is a Nice Phone,  a Glorified S7 In a Good Way","October 8, 2017",1,"1.- I bought the ""Phone Only"", this Amazon description makes it look or sound like you are buying a phone on a plastic bag or something,  but it comes in a nice box, with AWG (?) headphones, a pair of extra ear plugs, wall charger with USB cable, a USB adapter and a tool to pop up the phones SD/SIM card comparment...2.- A regular USB micro cable will not fit, but it comes with an adapter...It feels really good in my hand, I bought a Zizo Bolt case that comes with a glass protector.(see pics)..More to come later , but I'm a Samsung guy, so I know what to expect, but I'll post an update once i get to use it a little bit more..",30
1.0,Really bad service from Samsung. Front camera was defective.,"October 15, 2017",1,"Really bad service from Samsung. The phone came with a defect in the front camera. I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I  could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy..I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me ""Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back""..So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business?..I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase..",68
5.0,One of the best phones out there.,"November 14, 2017",1,"This phone is dope, it looks cool and it feels cool. Some people dont like where the finger print scanner is located but I dont really mind, I got used to it in a day but thats just me. This is one of the best phones I've had, its really fast and you can customize everything!..One thing I would like to point out, wich I havent seen any other reviewer talk about, is that when I put my SIM card inside the S8 it dint activate my LTE service, so this is what I did, grab another phone that has a SIM card from your same carrier and copy that phones VPN setting to your S8, it worked for me...Id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but I have a friend that has had her S8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance...Edit: I added some pictures of what I did with the VPN, you just have to manually copy the information from another cell phone to your S8, hope this helps..Ps.My friend dropped her phone a few days ago lol, buy a case..",7
5.0,Plain and Simple review.,"November 21, 2017",1,"Im not going to get into huge detail here, but I love this phone...The Camera is amazing.The screen is amazing.The fingerprint scanner works better than everyone says it does..I have taken this phone in the shower with me multiple times. 0 problems..it played music underwater (not recommended) with 0 problems..It does take a little getting used to, but the longer I have it, the more I love it..Honestly I can't think of one thing I don't like.except that I wish the bixby button was programmable...And I would recommend the otterbox Defender series case. Ive had it for weeks and it has been incredible..",7
4.0,Works great with Verizon!,"September 2, 2017",1,"The good: I'm really glad that I got this over spending more for a Verizon phone. There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures...The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level)..",5
1.0,"Can't disable ""personal assistant""","November 7, 2017",1,"So, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. But, I constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that I have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something...""But why don't you just disable it?"" you might say. Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable...So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. But take it from me, save yourself. Get a different phone now.",13
5.0,I do not regret buying!,"September 9, 2017",1,"I didn't think much of this phone as I was waiting for the Note 8. (Was a Note 4 user just 2 days before) But as the Note 8 became more disappointing with each leak, and esspecially after it's release with no embedded fingerprint scanner and a smaller battery than the S8+, I decided to look at the S8+. It was cheaper, has the same features as the Note 8 and, I believe it's safe to say, a better battery life. It was clear that this phone was next on the throne. While I wouldn't have the pen, I had to admit to myself that I hardly used the pen for the Note 4 anyway. No real loss there, so I ended up saving myself a few hundred bucks...As for the phone itself, I am very impressed. The display is so beautiful- especially with the infinity display. Textures look almost too real and the colors are so sharp and eye pleasing. Even in videos... I was also impressed with the battery life. Throughout the day I used the Note 4 and S8+ fairly equally and to my surprise, from 9am to 3pm the S8+ left me with 70% from 100% while my Note 4 had to be charged again from 100%...Customization is a must for me with any phone and this phone has outdone my expectation for any phone. Of course it has the basic customizations, but this phone goes so deep into it that I still haven't been able to see all that you can do with it after 2 days of use when I usually go through everything on a phone within a day...No phone is perfect and there's usually at least one thing I won't like about a phone. The ONLY thing I don't like about this phone is the placement of the speaker. It's located at the bottom of the phone in the right side, and that's a problem because I'm a gamer and I occasionally watch YouTube which I preferably use in landscape mode which requires that you turn the phone horizontally. When I hold the phone naturally in that position, I end up covering the speaker which forces me to readjust my grip to a more uncomfortable one...That being said, this phone is still the best one I could have purchased at this time and I do NOT regret buying it whatsoever..",4
4.0,"Worthy addition to the Galaxy S line, a good choice","December 14, 2017",1,"Great phone, first unlocked we've ever bought, and it was a great move.  It's great but not perfect...PROS.Excellent performance with all apps, very snappy.Beautiful screen (though very delicate).Light, great battery life..CONS.* Phone is slippery wherever you touch/grab it.  Hard to hold onto, unless you get a case, which you probably should..* Bixby assistant is very obtrusive and even has its own dedicated hard button on the left, which you will be mistakenly hitting often (you can sign into Samsung and set the button to do nothing, but you can't seem to reassign the button to be useful, or completely get rid of Bixby)..* Edge screen design is a novelty and more difficult to use than a standard screen.  I find myself having to try multiple times to get the right thing selected with my finger, because of the wrapping edges of the screen.* Doesn't seem to have a widget for flashlight built in, like my S5 had.",3
5.0,Works on Sprint Network,"August 25, 2017",1,"This phone was rated as ""good"" from warehouse deals. When it arrived it was in the factory box and looked like it had never been opened.  The plastic was still on the screen. I found no scratches or imperfections. My carrier is Sprint. It is truly unlocked for all carriers.They had me hooked up in about 15 minutes. The clerk asked me if i had bought the phone new from Samsung directly. He told me it was the unlocked version that would work internationally too.I have had the phone a couple of weeks and it has performed flawlessly. This was another great buy for me here on Amazon. If you are on the fence like I was about upgrading to the S8, go ahead and buy one here, its just an awesome phone. I had an S5 that was great but this S8 is so much better. Trust me on this. Go ahead and buy it. You will be amazed too!",10
5.0,Better value than the Note8,"October 26, 2017",1,"I waited until recently to purchase the S8+ as my original intention was to get the Note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted Note 7). However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper..So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward.  I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone..I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box..All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!..",2
5.0,The screen is breath taking,"October 4, 2017",1,"After using an old phone with such a large bezel, the switch to the Galaxy S8 was spectacular. I could not stop staring at the screen when I first saw it. There is just so much of it! After using this phone for a couple months, I have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product...Pros:.-Screen has amazing brightness, resolution and size..-Cameras are spectacular. Images are sharp and crisp..-Opposed to contrary belief, the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive.-Battery life is very good, also charges very quickly with the included Fast Charger.-Has Video Enhancement and Game Enhancement modes for when you need extra brightness, performance and screen resolution...Cons:.-Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case).-Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case).-Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential...Overall great phone and great experience so far. Would Recommend!.",3
5.0,This is the Phone of the Decade,"January 25, 2018",1,"I am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price...Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8"" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure.  The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung's ""Infinity Display"". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they've introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)..Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung's 'controversial' TouchWiz skin. However, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It's responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month...Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that's offered. With my iPhone, I've always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I've downloaded many things that I previously couldn't and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It's also IP68 certified dust and water resistant...Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone...Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear...Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work...Voice Command: Samsung has added a new 'Bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby 'levels'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps...Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn't trade it for anything else really. This is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. If you're holding out, don't wait! It's an experience unlike any other...NOTE: I have covered the broad specs of the S8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on Samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information..",2
1.0,Great hardware but two things that make it terrible,"January 22, 2018",1,"Great hardware but two things that make it terrible. Software especially phone dailer is terrible compared to stock android. You have to have a separate app just to check your voicemail with the S8 vs a Pixel where it is included with the dailer and a breeze to use. It may not sound like much but spending extra time going to that app wastes a lot time over time.  Also that bixby thing is terrible.  They won't let you turn it off without a Samsung account that they use to track you.  It pops all the time but after a while you figure out how to get it to stop saying ""hello, this bixby"" and then you learn how to get it stopped right away. Once again a big waste of time but at least it becomes less of a pain.  But really, why put up with any pain when this phone costs over $600?  Skip it, keep your old phone if it still works or buy something else.",4
5.0,Great product. Great phone. Great company.,"November 25, 2017",1,"I have had my Galaxy S8 for a little bit now and it has been great so far! I love how fast it is. I love the little things about it. The screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio. The fingerprint scanner is great and I know majority don't like the position but for me it works amazing. It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video. Honestly, I know I am bias towards Samsung products but everything I have had and also my friends/family have are amazing. They made great phones and appliances. Everything they make is top of the line and that's just the truth.",3
4.0,The literal definition of a glass cannon,"August 22, 2017",1,"First let me get this out of the way: This phone for the most part is awesome. The specs are beastly, the camera is among the best in class, the 1440p bezel-less curved display looks amazing, and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage. But while this phone is objectively one of the best out right now, it is also one of the most fragile. The backglass on mine broke within a week of usage and I actually had to replace the backglass in order to fix this. To put it in context, the only other phone glass that I have ever broke is the iPod Touch 4th gen, and I had that for nearly 2 years of usage before that happened. This is not a durable phone in the slightest, and I would highly recommend getting a case or skin for it if you plan to get this phone. Outside of that, this is a great phone and I'd recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues",10

2.0,Verizon phone!,"January 8, 2018",1,"The phone I received from this Amazon seller is an unlocked Verizon phone.  It may or may not have been ""unlocked by Samsung"", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone.  Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types.  When I put my AT&amp;T; sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying ""not a Verizon sim card"" error message in the notification tray.  You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone.  I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung.  It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it.  For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising...1/11/2018 -  Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today.  It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined.  Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from ""Electronic Deals"" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store..",2

It's not even close...* FYI ... I purchased a Verizon Prepaid SIM Card, as a suggested add-on through Amazon after adding the phone to my Cart.  The Verizon SIM Card is a 'Verizon Wireless SIM Kit Prepaid Sim Card - (Moto G &amp; Any Verizon Branded Phone)'.  When I attempted to activate the phone w/ SIM Card through the Verizon Wireless website, the activation would not complete &amp; Verizon claimed I needed a 'Samsung' SIM Car Kit.

5.0,"Great phone but careful, it not technically an Infinity Display.","September 20, 2017",1,"I will simply add to the ""I love it"" category but I do want to add something that might not be known. Samsung is a bit deceptive in their advertising of this phone. The infinity display is NOT really infinity. Notice they overexpose the edges on the image shown for this product. This is to hide the fact that the display does not really go from edge to edge. It goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display. It is not technically an Infinity display. That's a bit of a letdown, but not a game changer for me in saying I still love the phone. Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick, that is awesome.",2

It's the one thing that needs to be addressed and fixed - a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be OK with. I also don't really like the absence of a ""home"" button, and the Bixby button on the left side of the phone is RIDICULOUS. You think you're pressing the volume button, and instead you get the Bixby screen pop up. I've yet to use it - Google Assistant works like a charm on this phone and wakes up with ""OK Google""...On the plus side, this phone qualifies for Sprint's 1 year free unlimited bring your own phone plan...",1
1.0,Motherboard replaced!!!!,"February 14, 2018",1,"Read my review before make your decision!!!!!!!!!.I have purchased the S8 from this seller for around 5 months only. I have never dropped the device, never done any physical damage to the device, never done anything to the operating system. Then when I was using the cellphone for fun, suddenly it shows an problem: Device Storage Corrupted..Therefore, considering this device is still under US one-year warranty, as the seller states in the product description, I contacted Samsung service and sent the S8 to repair. However, Samsung repair center told me that the motherboard of this device is replaced, therefore, it is out of warranty... I am not sure if the seller has an explanation on this?..If not, I can only suspect that the seller has done something to the device. Then Do not buy anything from the seller! It will not be under the warranty if there is any problem!!! The Samsung would say it is not from official sellers, they won't be responsible for it!!!..",3
1.0,Horrible Connectivity Issues,"November 28, 2017",1,"Was supposed to be unlocked and compatible with cellular/data programs offered by, among other major providers, Verizon.  Well, it wasn't.  Finally took it to a Verizon store and was told that the phone was simply not compatible with Verizon. So Frustrating! It's so obvious the answer is the best course of action is to go to a provider brick and mortar store (in this case Verizon), and buy the phone there.  Whatever the difference in price is, if any, is more than offset by the time and hassle saved. Ugh!",3
3.0,Great specced phone with some major drawbacks,"December 1, 2017",1,"I have had this phone for several months now...This phone has great specs and does not fail in that regard. It also contains many of the features expected of flagship phones such as waterproofing and wireless charging..With that said, I had 3 concerns when initially purchasing this phone after coming from a Nexus 6P...1. Phone updates, including upgrades to new versions of Android..2. Non-stock experience, including many Samsung apps already installed..3. Single bottom firing speaker...With that said, the first issue is still a concern. Updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android. This is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another Samsung phone again..The second issue has been less of a concern for me. Many of the Samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock Android. They are very usable and are worth giving a try..The third issue is still and issue, but some people have been able to enable stereo functionality, but will require rooting the phone.

After analyzing the issue (Samsung has internal hardware checking menu), I found out that it was hardware issue. It was confirmed and fixed by Samsung center in Manhattan (Guys at ""Samsung 837"" are great. If anyone lives in NYC Metro area, you should visit Samsung 837: great service, great experience and they do not try to sell, they just show the products and explain).",1

At home I get gigabit wifi. It was a little weird to look at the curved sides, but I got used to it after about 2 days. I highly recommend the OtterBox Defender case because this phone, like many others, is a bit too thin for large hands.",1

I did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro SD card (which is allowed with this device) and it worked fine ever since I bought it..However Amazons warranty is not so great. Samsung does offer a 1 year manufacturers warranty on NEW items. The CSR (Customer Support Representative) was helpful and straight forward. You do have to ship the phone to them, but they will email you a paid for shipping label (Print 3 to place on 3 sides of the box). Excluding the shipping time, maintenance and processing will take 9-11 business days. Obviously no one should have to deal with this in the first place, but I just want a helpful review if someone has a bad situation happen to them like I did. Samsung's CSR is 866-371-9501. Follow the menu prompts and you will get the option to speak to a CSR (it can get annoying waiting through all the options but you'll get there)..",1
5.0,Really a great Smart Phone,"October 22, 2017",1,"The screen is incredible.  One of the best Android phones out there if not the best.  Camera is great in low light situations.  Battery life is good and lasts me the whole day.  Also has a quick charging feature if you use supported Qualcomm quick charge adapters.  Only thing that annoys me is the Bixby feature.  I basically have disabled it and switched over to the Google Assistant.  Default Samsung applications for basic smart phone use are very good and minimalistic.  For example the calendaring, contacts, and messaging apps all support the basic needed functionality well.  Best thing though is the screen when you are watching HighDef video content or viewing your photos.  Really clear when you've got the right content.",0
2.0,Avoid and wait it out until Pixel 3 comes out,"November 4, 2017",1,"If you consider purchasing Galaxy S7, S8, or Note 8 then you should read this review first. You may have heard from YouTubers that this is the best android device or the best they have ever used or best display on the market. Some of it is true, but there is more things that the YouTube reviewers don't discuss on their channel. Samsung is really slow when it comes down to pushing newer security updates and even slower pushing newer version of Android. The most important is constantly getting security updates, there are two major bugs that recently shake the smartphone industry, ""KRACK (Wi-Fi Bug)"" &amp; ""BLUEBORNE (Bluetooth Bug)"" every single devices were affected including Apple devices. That said, Google (Nexus and Pixel) and Apple already patched their respective devices, but Samsung is still behind and that leaves vulnerable to hack. May be, you own a business and getting a device to run your business and would carry all the important documents, bank information, or any business related information, your information is at risk...Samsung has come a long way from their Galaxy S4 and Note 3 days, their software is much better now, but it is no where near close to Google's Pure Android that is currently being used on Nexus and Pixel. Samsung Experience/Touchwiz is bloated with unnecessary features and apps that runs in the background and eats up the battery. I have seen much better software experience on Google Pixel, and some other devices from Motorola and Sony. Some people love the Samsung's extra features and use them often, but others don't prefer and want something that is constantly being updated with security measures. There are other issues too related to Samsung Experience (former Touchwiz); I have found various bugs that are not annoying at all, and doesn't hinder day to day use, but they are there. Samsung needs to streamline the experience, and curate it towards what consumers really want and prefer. I do not recommend this device...If you have the device that is working perfectly fine, I suggest you wait it out until next Galaxy or Pixel 3 or get Sony Xperia XZ1. And if your device is broken and need something immediate and wants to spend money, it is entirely up to you...",5

Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. One excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously.

Also, it being unlocked worked out. I thought it was going to be a hassle but I walked right into AT&amp;T; and they had my new phone and new service up and running within 30 minutes. Great buy in my opinion. Being a prime member was worth it in the end also because it arrived on Sunday as promised. The only thing the US post office service dropped this VERY expensive device at the door without knocking to let anyone know it was there! As opposed to UPs or FEDEX they don't bother to get you to sign. I would advice using one of the Amazon mailbox stations at the QT gas station or where ever they are closest to your location.

I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like ""her"" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him..Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge ""tray"" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden.

My college has free wifi and it worked perfectly fine on my S7edge, but on my S8, it said wifi is blocked. I tried wifi in Mcdonalds, parks, restaurants, and the wifi are all blocked. What on earth?

I have been using it for a few days now and it works well. Also, I must say i got my metro pcs SIM to work in it and it was like a 123 set up. The signal is good. Overall, it's a great phone eventhough it maybe be too early to tell. I will give an update in a few months time.",0

5.0,Excellent phone,"November 3, 2017",1,"I love this phone,  this is the replacement of an iphone 5 and I don't miss it at all.  Before buying the Samsung Galaxy S8 I was debating if I should get the Iphone 8 instead but Apple's strategy of releasing 3 phones a couple months apart just didn't make sense to me, it makes you think.  After reading reviews explaining how Samsung has been releasing phones for years with technology that Apple now says is revolutionary with their Iphone X,  my decision was easily made... the S8 is an excellent phone with all the bells and whistles for an amazing price.",0

The phone itself is fine however upon boot it appeared to be defaulted to Spanish. Not a good sign. The phone is touted to be an unlocked US version of the phone, however, this does not appear to be the case for the one I got. After changing the language for the phone and pulling the version number (SM-G950F), I determined this one to be a European version. There is NO CDMA radio capability and Verizon fails to provision this phone on their network. A bit disappointed and returning.",1
5.0,Works great,"February 25, 2018",1,I worried about ordering 1 of these after reading the reviews over and over again....

5.0,Super fast processor,"February 26, 2018",1,"Honestly, samsung really hit it big with this one. Although I'm sure the Note 8 is even more impressive, I've found perfection in the S8. Super fast processor, radiant screen that takes up the entire phone, amazing specs and of course the design was well thought through. I'm living it. I won't be buying the s9 because I'll wait till something surpasses this by a mile!!",1

4.0,Everything good except charger,"January 2, 2018",1,The  Phone is very good with many new functions. I like the edge design. Also bixby and samsung health is a good addition. Holds the charge almost for a day if you are actively using it but the charger is not functioning after 4 months.,1

5.0,Great phone,"November 27, 2017",1,I absolutely love this phone. I made the switch from apple to android with the latest phone updates and it was the best decision I could have made. There are so many more things you can customize with the phone and it's settings it really makes it personal.,2

1.0,BEWARE - KNOWN ISSUES WITH TEXTING,"August 19, 2017",0,"KNOWN ISSUES WITH TEXTING - read the Samsung forums before buying this phone. I sent my 2 month old phone in for repair when it stopped sending texts after a security update, and it was supposedly repaired but is still not working! Tech support and Sales pointed fingers at one another and have given me the runaround and refused a refund. Hard to believe Samsung hasn't improved their customer support after the S7 debacle. So far I've wasted hundreds of dollars on a paperweight and hours of my time on the phone with Samsung. Buy a reliable but inexpensive Moto G5 plus instead if you require texting capabilities on your phone!",95

3.0,Good battery life,"September 16, 2017",1,"Pros: The phone is fast..Good battery life..Very nice looking phone..Display looks very nice...Cons:  My hand would often unintentionally touch a part of the wrap around screen and close browser windows, apps, etc.  This happened often enough to be fairly annoying..Several apps were buggy and would close by themselves or would just not work at all (such as cycletrader app).  There were some annoying quirks with the youtube app..The fingerprint reader is the worst I've used yet, it always took at least 3 or 4 tries every time I got my phone out.  Super annoying..Facial recognition on this phone is a joke..I don't like Samsung's overlay on Android Nougat.  The Samsung keyboard sucks. Stock Android is so much nicer IMO...Overall, for a flagship phone and even at a deeply discounted price I wasn't too impressed with this one.  I have a feeling I would be much happier with a Pixel or the upcoming Pixel 2........",5

4.0,No premium care if purchased from Amazon,"November 3, 2017",1,"Overall pretty nice phone. Being water resistant is a major plus, and the fact that the touch screen still mostly works while wet is amazing. It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes...Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did)...Despite my many complaints about Samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock OS works well with some tweaks.",3
5.0,Works with Sprint,"August 18, 2017",1,"**CAVEAT EMPTOR** My phone and phone box were labelled with the wrong MEID number. When I called Sprint to activate, they told me it wasn't unlocked, so you can imagine my frustration. I finally figured out that if you dial *#06#, it will show you your phone's serial number, MEID #, and IMEI#, which turned out was different than what was on the box or the back of the phone. When I then called Sprint to activate with the actual number and my Sprint SIM card, and everything worked out fine...As to the phone itself, it's great. The screen is nice and large, responsive, good speakers, I like the water resistant design, and the swag is great (comes with the charger w/ USB cable, a transfer USB set to transfer info from your old Samsung phone, and a set of headphones. One of the best things about this phone is that it has NONE of the bloatware that comes with Sprint phones that can't be disabled or turned off...Overally, outside of the hassle, this is a great deal on a great phone..",5

1.0,"Beware - possible NO sms texting,","November 30, 2017",1,"Received this phone 3 days ago, and finally got the SIM card from VZN.  Apparently, this phone has an issue with NOT being able to send sms texts.  Spent 2 hours in the Verizon store trying to get it sorted out.  2 factory resets, and 2 additional SIM cards - still will not send SMS texts...Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is:.-The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment.  Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone..Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera.  Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around...So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner.  If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere...I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time).  Returning this POS........",2
5.0,The best phone I have ever used,"October 31, 2017",1,The best phone I have ever used... great battery life... beautiful screen just love my s8 plus.... only  thing is have to keep it fragile as the body is all beautiful  glass.. rest everything is deluce,1
1.0,NEVER BUY THIS PHONE OR DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY!,"November 19, 2017",0,"To be honest, I purchased this phone June 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. The biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. Every time I let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. Not sleep, not screen off, SHUT DOWN. It has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the ""best phone out there""..Next, the always on screen. Sometimes it is literally ALWAYS ON. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. Anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if I a not watching. Also, in this state, if it isn't charging and I put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. The only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. Very frustrating but I dealt with it because it is ""the best phone out there""...Now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. I assume the battery had dies so I plugged it in. Normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. The LED light would also blink at the top....nothing. No LED light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. I then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling Samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. It just will not turn on...So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things I just spent 3 hours trying. Still nothing. I also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that ""During the applicable warranty period, provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty, Samsung will repair or replace the Product, at Samsung’s sole option, without charge."" So i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and I would ship this broken one back, done....nope. The woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though I read her word for word what the warranty stated. The only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. All of which will take 2 weeks! I replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. I asked her nicely again to replace it as I cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. After a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. Very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently  but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on Samsung products...So now I am sending the phone back to Samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. In the interim I plan to buy another phone THAT WILL NOT BE SAMSUNG. I have been a Samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, TVs, all new kitchen appliances. To be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. After tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. This is the reason why Samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. As far I am concerned there will never be another Samsung product in my home and I will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty...Unless this company makes this right I will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another Samsung product, period. The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. Losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. Further I plan to post this review anywhere I can so that as many people considering Samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus...",62

1.0,What a piece of junk!!!,"January 21, 2018",1,"I had high hope for Samsung's flagship phone, but was very disappointed...The positives:..1.  The phone has a headphone jack, an SD Card slot, and wireless charging..2.  The phone is unlocked and has the transmitters necessary to work on all four U.S. carriers..3.  The Wireless Hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege..4.  The Screen is sharp and bright, just like prior Galaxy phones...The negatives:..1.  No hard button on the front.  I really appreciated that the earlier Galaxy phones that had a physical button.  I like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you.  It allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place.  That tactile feedback is missing on this phone.  Also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button TWICE, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/PIN.  That means a total of FOUR actions just to get the phone to the home screen.  That's just stupid...2.  No user replaceable battery.  This is simply inexcusable.  I know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary.  There is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user.  It would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover.  Even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery.  I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S3 and S4, both of which had a user replaceable battery...3.  Oddly sized:  This phone is too tall and too narrow.  As a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well...4.  Oddly shaped:  The waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved TV sets.  Initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image.  In the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges.  It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped...5.  Bixby Button:  Bixby is a Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri.  There's a dedicated Bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button.  Samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button.  But, in order to do so, you *must* create a Samsung account, share some personal information with Samsung, and link Bixby to the account.  Until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button.  Again, this is stupid.  If Bixby is so great, people will choose to use it.  Samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so...In the end, even though I got a smoking $574 Black Friday price on this phone from Amazon.com, I'm going to send it back and either keep my S6, or upgrade to S7 instead........",5

The worst was when I wanted to take a video and yours truly Bixby vision came up and I missed the shot. There are other problems but all were minor what bothers me is the amount of small problems.

No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen...I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER...",32

2.0,Not in love with the latest flagship from Samsung,"October 11, 2017",1,"I have owned the galaxy S2,S3, and S6(flat Display). With all of those phones I was happy from purchase, to replacement (usually fleeting battery life). I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed...Cons.1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed).2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried..3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen).4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement..5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future...Pros - (most other flagships are equal here).1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining..2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps..3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices..4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too...In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display.  I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months...Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if,.1. I can get a flat display again.2. Take the buttons off the screen..3. Bring fingerprint scanner back to front..",6

For example having different sounds for different apps,Facebook,messanger,emails and so on does not seem to work or at least I have not made it happen.

I called Samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. Still didn't work. Face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely...Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare. Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, Bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method).

1.0,The camera is great but the phone itself,"August 15, 2017",0,The camera is great but the phone itself....negative.  The glass on this phone is very fragile.  Even in a case this phone is fragile. Most cases cannot protect the infinity screen.  Visit Samungs website and go to the community forum and look for broken screens.  I wish I had before my purchase.  I shattered the back and it is costing me $70 to repair.  And of course if there is physical damage it voids the warranty.  So use super thin glass and then sit back and collect the repair money. I guess they had to make up for the Note 7 somehow.,32
1.0,Beautiful phone however the glass is junk,"August 7, 2017",0,This phone is great except for the fact that the screen scratches incredibly easily.  Just going in and out of my pocket the phone shows a multitude of scratch marks running up both edges of the face and randomly across the front.  All I can say is that gorilla glass 5 is definitely not where it's at.  If the screen didn't scratch so easily I would definitely recommend this phone but because of it I would definitely wait for something else.,94

I even went to the Apple store to check out the iPhone X - side by side the Galaxy still looks 10 times better..  I love it.  Customization...  Removable memory.  The best phone on the planet.,0
3.0,Wait for the S9 or stick with S7,"October 13, 2017",0,"I have been using Samsung phones for 10 yrs..They have made advancements with the S8+, which I truly enjoy however there are too many draw backs for me...The bixby feature is awesome, it took a while to really get use out of bixby for me. You really have to use it in order for it to learn and be useful. I recommend setting it up and going through the prompts, play with it for an hour or two. Set up short cuts. I found that ""take me home"" phrase I used when asking the previous assistant Galaxy to navigate home, does not work on bixby unless you set up a short cut. I do not however like the button. I find myself accidentally hitting the button all the time which disrupts what I'm doing on my phone because then you must wait for the bixby home page to load before you may close out...Two major complaints:..The battery. I was blown away by the battery life when I first got my S8+! I've read a lot about battery preservation so I do not charge my phone while I'm sleeping because leaving it on the charger when it's fully charged kills the battery longevity. So I charge a couple hours a day while I'm at work and that's it. I stream music in the car so I expected that to drain the battery quickly but it did not! After exactly 6 months of use, my phone now loses about 30/40% just sitting idle while I don't use it in just about 3 hours. When I noticed this draining battery issue I immediately took action. I deleted every app that I don't use on a weekly basis. I set up the power saving mode. I changed screen settings. It has helped a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. I now have to charge my phone constantly..Because of the very iPhone-esk style they took begining with the S7, the phone now has a glass back that is not removable. Making the purchase of a new battery to fix said problem impossible. I've always liked samsungs products..but this was a poor decision for their consumers...The screen. While the screen is beautiful and ""unboxed""...it is 10x more fragile than any other Samsung or Galaxy I have owned. I cracked my screen within two weeks of ourchase. I was and still am, unable to find a tempered glass screen protector with a fully adhesive screen (because of the new design with the edge). I have sworn by tempered glass screen protectors in the past, they have saved me so many times. I was also unable to find one for the S7 as well. I did purchase one that only adhered on the edges, which did exactly what I thought it would.  It slid off the couch onto carpet and the screen popped right off the phone. Which for the record does nothing to absorb shock and prevent damage. I have the OtterBox symmetry case on my phone and it still cracked when dropped. Right on the stupid edge of the screen where it curves. Then a few months later, it slides off a shelf in the restroom and lands on tile flooring. Shatters again. I have shattered 3 out of the 4 corners on my screen all while in a case. I'd hate to see what happens when it's not in a case...Overall I am disappointed with this new screen, while it is beautiful and excellent for my photography hobby...it just isn't durable or practical. While the new technology advancements Android has made are excellent, I absolutely hate the quality of the phone. It's literally an $800 glass box around a computer.",24
1.0,The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks,"September 28, 2017",0,"Don't get me wrong, the functionality of this phone is incredible. However, the phone might as well come with a broken screen. This is the first phone that I have ever broken. And within 3 months of owning it, I have broken the screen twice. Both times were low impact falls from heights of about 2 feet while sitting. Furthermore, it breaks through a case, which is even more baffling...The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks, you're left with an item that you just paid $400 - $800 feeling like you're trying to wait out a contract until your next upgrade is available. It would be nice to just fix the screen that Samsung should honestly feel ashamed about but that costs $150 - $200 unless you do it yourself. And then you are right back at square one with a new fragile screen not suitable for a device that is considered ""mobile.""..I plan on coughing up the deductible to file an insurance claim on the phone. Mostly because the second break occurred in a way that a shard of glass is now impressing the screen preventing me from escaping a black screen while on a phone call. It otherwise works but I cannot look at texts/internet or even hang-up while taking a call...I would strongly advise against buying this phone. Even though I enjoyed my 3 months of use, I wish I had not bought it. Its pretty disappointing that Samsung is not remedying the fagility of this phone in mass. It's comical that a purchaser needs to constantly worry about a $200 bill while using this phone in a fairly standard way. The iPhone X is also a frightening phone since it looks like the same design. I would be exceedingly hesitant to buy anything that even remotely resembles this design in the future..",37

One to two bars if I'm lucky and it constantly drops calls and fails to send text. I really like this phone so bit the bullet and purchased a cell phone extender antenna for version . Another $130 added and a real pain to install. After all this it's not better if anything it's worse.  IS THIS PHONE WORTH IT ?

1.0,"I don't want thing that only work with Samsung, I want things that work with Android.","December 6, 2017",1,"I have many Samsung products, and am happy with all of them, but I am not happy that this phone requires not just one, but two proprietary pieces in order to charge it properly, or one just to hook it up to another device. It does not have a Micro USB connection, it has an adapter that you need to use just to hook it up to a Micro USB cord. If you plug the USB end into any normal charger, or even a USB port on a computer, the phone takes FOREVER to charge (25% charge over 8 hours). You need to plug the cord into Samsung's ""adaptive fast charger"" in order for it to charge in a reasonable amount of time. The whole reason I buy Android instead of iPhone is because I don't want to have proprietary software, hardware or peripherals, I want to buy things that work across multiple devices. I have Micro USB cords everywhere, at home, in my car, at work, one stashed in my luggage in case I forget to pack one on vacation... now, they are all useless to charge this phone unless I happen to have not one, but both of the proprietary parts needed to charge the thing. Unless, of course, I pay them just to have extras so that I can conveniently charge my phone anywhere that I am. It really seems like Samsung is trying to separate themselves from all other Android products by having their own charging devices, and they even have their own Apps and a Browser. All of this I can avoid if I choose, except the charger part...I, like others, have most everything set up through Google, but Samsung wants to force you to use their Apps and software, like Bixby, their version of a personal assistant. And there is no way to replace Bixby, you can turn it off, but the home key is forever tied to this app. I don't want thing that only work with Samsung, I want things that work with Android...The phone does not have a way to double tap a notification to open it; you need to unlock the phone, then open your notification. I've researched this online, and others have the same complaint and no way to turn on that functionality....",3

1.0,Form Over Function -- took away the most important features,"November 6, 2017",0,"I am a long time Galaxy user.  My whole family and I have had Samsung Galaxies since the S3.  But this S8 annoys me to no end.  They are turning the Galaxy into an iPhone.  If I wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, I would have bought an iPhone.  But I didn't...Battery:  I have had this S8 for 9 weeks now.  I cannot make it through the day without the phone dying.  That's bad enough.  But far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. Lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the Achilles heel of iPhones.  iPhone users constantly complain about it.  So what does Samsung do?  Make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery.  So I guess we're supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. If all the other Galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature?  And don't tell me for waterproofing.  I don't care.  You should be able to figure that out...All-Glass Case:  Are you kidding me?  If you look at the phone wrong, it will break.  And it's unbelievably slippery.  Nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back.  People are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the T-Mobile store and the time Amazon Prime can deliver a protective case. And even with a case, it'll break. I mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass.  Of course it's going to break...Proprietary charging port:  The Galaxy S5 had a USB 3.0.  That was genius, seriously.  The S5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with USB 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it.  In addition, USB 3.0 is super fast for data transfers.  So, what does Samsung do?  Create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn't exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented.  What a great idea -- let's turn the best charging system into the worst.  And that's even worse than Apple.  iPhones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iPhones that use their proprietary cable.  In this case, only the S8 uses this useless connection...Infinity Display:  Samsung touts the ""uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges"".  Okay, one question.  Did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market?  Because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the ""seamless edges."" Obviously.  So, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. So, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone.  I'd like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool?  In case someone from Samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: NO ONE.  No one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone...In other words -- form over function.  Give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway.  Stop copying Apple, and bring back a real Samsung Galaxy...",32

4.0,Detailed Review from Dedicated iPhone User,"August 5, 2017",0,"Are you on ios and wondering how difficult jumping ship to the android flagship phones would be?  Well, that is exactly what I did and here is my experience...I'm starting with my Conclusion because this is long: I love the hardware aspect of the Galaxy S8+ with very few exceptions. It's a beautiful phone. After a couple of weeks I have my phone useable with fairly similar apps and functions I used on iPhone. I like quite a bit of the additional functionality and customization offered. However, using the phone is like having every developer trying to turn the phone into a personal billboard trying to sell me something unless I'm willing to shell out $2 to $3 per app in most cases. To gain some of the higher end customization without ads can cost $5 or more in many cases.  It is quite a bit less efficient in every day use due to lack of streamlined integration between apps and additional ads...ABOUT ME.I have pretty much used ios for all my smartphone and tablet needs for about 8 years (or whenever iPhone 3gs came out - I'm 99% sure it was before 2010).  I tested an android tablet for about 5 years ago and I was not impressed with the weight of the device nor the android apps so I stayed with ios.  I'm pretty sure after that experience is when I purchased my first iPad.  About a month ago I had a water incident with my iphone 6 plus and had to decide what phone to upgrade to..My motivation is because there are so many exciting phones in the near future, the Samsung reviews are extremely positive, and the Samsung S8+ is so much cheaper than the iphone 7+ after just months of being on the market (and I don't think this trend will change anytime soon). I jumped ship from ios so I could make a better decision about the next iPhone before its release (iPhone 8+ or whatever they name it).  I've used the Samsung Galaxy Plus phone exclusively for about 3 weeks. Here is what I struggled with, my suggestions for non-android users, what I've learned about android ecosystem, the pros and cons post switching, and what I will likely choose next...PHONE DESIGN.Big Pro - This phone design makes people drool. It looks great and it feel great in the hand - especially when you compare the plus size versions.  I could have gone with the plain size of this phone and been absolutely happy. My eyesight isn't that great so the larger screen is great..Pro - The size of the phone is great in the hand.  The smaller one is even better. It feels better than iPhone Plus in the pocket, however the height is about the same so short pockets still cause issues..Pro - Build quality seems top of the line. Buttons work great, etc..Pro - I like the color options better than other phones out there..Meh - Expected to be a fingerprint magnet - and it is. LOL.Con - The hard to reach finger scanner on back - I type the unlock code OFTEN due to placement..Con - Dedicated Bixby button - this button is just in the way; its placement causes accidental Bixby engagement all the time and Samsung has locked users out of reassigning the button..PERFORMANCE/BATTERY.Pro/Meh - In terms of speed the OS (Android Nougat I believe) on this device has come quite a long way. Overall I found the OS response almost on par with ios.  I understand the difference between open architecture and Apple's closed architecture, so this is a great achievement but it doesn't outperform ios in my use so I can't mark it as a clear Pro. It felt capable in every way. It didn't glitch in a way that I didn't find acceptable but ios still wins here..Pro - The ability to change performance modes is nice for increasing battery life or performance. I don't play any high performance games, but the gaming folder options to set the phone as a priority for gaming (no interruptions and high performance) may be the reason for some users to choose this over iPhone..Pro - Quick charging and wireless charging are nice to have available (although I dont have those set up in my house)..Meh - With the customization of this phone, it is easy to affect battery life without realizing it. In real day to day useage, I don't have all my charging stations set up for this phones usb c connector - I have iPhone chargers set up in many rooms of my house out of necessity. With most of the usb chargers I have, I dont feel this phone charges much faster than my iPhone. In my experience so far the phone underestimates how long it will take to get to a full charge by quite a bit maybe 20 or 30 percent. The good part is that I don't think it will be any worse than using my iPhone - but I'm not charging this thing any less either..DURABILITY.Big Pro - Waterproof. Since my last phone died due water and I was always putting my phone in a ziplock bag to run when weather was questionable or out at the lake, this is something I am glad to have..Meh - Screen glass is marketed to be pretty scratchproof. I've ordered a screen protector and I tried to keep the film on the glass while waiting for it to arrive, but the film didnt stay adhered but 4 days or so.  I've been careful and only carry the phone in my pocket by itself and I have a scratch. I've never scratched a phones screen this quickly but there are so many factors that I won't list it as a con..Meh - I cant speak to back durability personally since I was able to find protector quickly and have not dropped the phone. But videos online show that the back can crack if dropped on concrete from only 3 feet which is about waist height. Although other drop tests show it surviving drops from 5 feet, most crack the backglass at this height. Drop tests online seem to indicate decent front durability often surviving a 5 foot drop. From what I've researched, the front seems as durable as (if not a bit more than) an iPhone and the back really dictates a cover..SCREEN.Pro - The screen resolution is great. I do like the screen, but in use at mid arms length away I can't tell much difference with the resolution at max or the mid setting. I appreciate the ability to run mine at the mid setting to save battery life..Big Pro - I stream movies on my phone often and getting a larger video with a more narrow phone is a GREAT experience..Pro - The curved glass is just sexy on electronics. The screens edge does a great job of ignoring touches when holding the phone. That edge is visible when the phone is face down so it can be set for notifications and I've seen the ability to run a stock ticker down it..Pro - Always on display with very little battery impact. I didn't realize how often I turn on my phone just to see the time or even date. Once this is set to disply the things you are 'just checking,' you will save some battery life..Con - The screen seems VERY dim in comparison to iPhone. It is capable of a comfortable brightness, but when maxed out I feel like I'm using a reduced setting from my iPhone..CAMERA.Pro - That damn camera bump is gone!!! This phone will sit flat on the table - nuff said if you are using an iPhone..Pro - The cameras (hardware) on this phone are best in class.  I give this phone the edge because in low light, it captures more light than any Apple phone.  In bright light, it's a draw unless you truly have need of the 2 cameras on the iphone.  In my use, my cropped images come out great so a 2nd lens doesn't add the same value as low light performance.  My video needs are the same - I need more low light performance than ability to use a different lens..MEH - I'm not labeling this a con on purpose.  I know there is a phone out there with 2 backfacing lenses. 2 lenses do not make me want that bump on the back of my phone..STORAGE.Pro - You get a respectable 64 Gig onboard and can add a card (whenever you need it) to increase it at a reasonable price using standard 3rd party memory cards.  None of that bulls**t Apple gouging..PORTS/BLUETOOTH.Pro - Its accessories are all generic. It is so nice to buy an extra cable for $2. I know I can buy 3rd party apple cables but some fit well and some are so tight you may damage the phone. I LOVE not having to deal with that - although switching all my phone docks and cables did cost a few bucks. If the next iPhone switches its port, I wouldn't be able to use them anyway..Pro - The earphone jack. I am no audiophile and have gone wireless for audio in most ways. But by design, my car connects phones to the radio with an audio cable. This phone requires nothing new to use that. Its an added plus when I forget to charge my wireless headphones..Con - The usb c connection just doesn't feel as tight to me.  When I connect the cable it doesnt align straight as easily as the lightning connector - even with using the cables provided with phone. Also, I get errors from different chargers that the phone is not connected completely. I think the error is because the phone is expecting a fast charger, but it has me a little concerned about reliability in the back of my mind..AUTHENTICATION/SECURITY.Pro - Eyescanner is great for unlocking phone. I've had better restults than many reviews. Mine will usually scan me correctly from a reading position if I pull the phone up toward my face about 2 feet. Even in dim light it usually reads which greatly reduces this next con..Con - I am sooo used to the fingerscanner, it is an unatural action to unlock ANYTHING on this phone. The placement is not where I can reach it naturally so I have to shift the phone to scan and it has gotten to be a real pain in the ass when I unlock apps..Con - Eyescanner either does not work to unlock apps (like paypal, etc) or it isn't coded in a way to easily connect it. It seem to only unlock phone..Con - Did I mention logging into apps is a pain in the ass on this phone? Dashlane is an app that makes this a bit more bearable but once you know how easy it is on Apple it is hardly comparable replacment. If you use financial apps, you will dedicate some time to trying to get around this. I think on the standard phone the fingerprint scanner felt more accessible so this may be an issue specific to the plus model..Meh - Facescanner is available but a photo can unlock the phone. As easily hacked as this is, I don't see the point of using this. Maybe if I wanted to lock a younger child out of my phone. Anyone over the age of 8 that wants to get into your phone will get past this lock..Meh - I generally don't feel as secure with my data in the apps, OS, and features of this phone and the android infrastructure. Many find this a pro since you can choose all these different apps to help. It is the same feeling when I use my windows computer, security is all on my shoulders and I better address it someway. And all the free solutions have ads. Apple has a great track record with securing data, privacy, etc. Everything I read about setting up android points you to security features to enable. Am I protected? I've installed some suggested apps, but who the hell knows..CUSTOMIZATION.Pro - Out of the box, this phone is one of the most highly customizable phones available to change your experience to how you want the phone to look and behave. You can add and remove features of the OS (like the app drawer which iphone users do not have), edit how app icon looks, rename or remove app names, etc. Some customizations are pretty sweet - like backgrounds can move with movement of the phone and the camera can be used to sync the background with whatever colors the camera is capturing..Pro - The keyboard can be reduced in size and offset to the side of your prominent hand so that the keys are easy to reach with one hand. If the Big Con for word prediction didnt exist, this might be a reason to change phones when using plus size..Meh - Speech of OS. It is good but Apple does relistic speech better..Con (if new to android) - It is overwhelming to use this phone out of the box without some grounding first. It may be licensing or userbase expectation, but there are dual applications for many functions. It is preinstalled with Samsungs version of chat, email, and browser apps as well as the Android standard equivilent. As you set these up and start using them, they'll be prompting back and forth to change defaults. Some are similarly named and the functions between each have nothing dictating where the app settings will be located, how to engage the settings, etc. The OS does not have any wizard guiding you through steps in an order that makes sense. Apple sort of walks you through step by step of creating your Apple account first, then security choices, etc. You get none of that here. You keep tinkering with creating accounts and settings until something works, then you move onto the next thing you want to work. It may take a week to get this phone to replace an iPhone completely if you use many apps at all..Big Con - Using the keyboard drives me close to insanity because of how often the wrong word appears. It is functional (I've defaulted to using Gboard after some comparing of 3rd party) but it takes about twice the effort as iPhone. If I hadn't used iPhone I likely wouldn't notice but I have used one and I notice this fault - every time I have to type an email or text message..Con - I have some loss in trust in settings to take and work as expected. I've had this phone ring at work when I thought I had do not disturb set. I do not know why the setting changed and it was easy enough to address, but you must click and look for check marks, okays, enable, save buttons that iPhone never requires you to click.  There is no standard across the platform so unless you exit and go back into a setting, I never know it took..Big Con (for my use) - Enabling handicap features can be painful. On iPhone, I can set my phone up to triple tap to enable text to speech so the OS will read aloud to me. I use this very often to have kindle books read to me without having to rely on audible or paying for whispersync books. Enabling this on android is very difficult and it will not continue to read past a paragraph max. If someone has figured this out, please respond with comment..Big Big Big Con - Ads, ads, everywhere. Do you like having your phone boot into a screen with a big ad displayed in the middle of it? Well android provides that functionality - in fact every developer over uses it in a way iPhone users do not experience. Once you customize and get some crazy ad resulting, you'll need an app to find what is causing it. In fact, I almost returned this phone on day 2 because of an ad. And I got some good advice I'm passing along to you if you keep reading..FUNCTIONS.Pro - Best 3d experience available on a phone. For under $10 you can get a 3d headset for your phone and be immersed in some pretty awsome videos. Yes, iPhone does this too, but Samsung does it better. What I did not know is that the experience is 360 degrees. You'll need to stand up to turn around and see what is behind you, but when you are flying in that jet, you can see the pilot if you turn around. I watched a cartoon with aliens in front of me and rabbit hiding behind me and I missed half of the action because I kept trying to check what the rabbit was doing. This is not something I need to have in anyway, but it is fun and costs very little to get set up. Be forewarned, you will be seasick after your first use and riding a rollercoaster standing up in 3d can make you fall down..Pro - Audio over wireless just sounds better to me compared to iPhone 6. I don't know about other versions but with same headsets I get more bass, etc..Meh - Phone calls are okay but I'm not impressed with the app. It is harder to use and integration between apps is not all that great. Here are some of the items harder than iPhone - answering a call, finding and calling a contact, setting up a 3way call, adding a new call into a current call (still haven't gotten it to happen), selecting a phone number in another app and having phone app open and call..Meh - Bixby is Samsungs response to Siri (and Google Assistant which is on this phone also).  In concept Bixby should develop into something more useful than Siri for chaining commands together (set this setting and opne this app, or open this app and do this), but it is not fully realized yet. Having to hold the button for the duration of the command comes difficult to me and it feels unnecessary and I just don't like it. And I don't like that button anyway. Engaging google assistant is the same as Siri and I like that way of turning it on better. I've used Siri more so I know what to expect and I know what it does. I have less favorable results with both of these but Bixby was only recently enabled. I think it may develop into something pretty nice to use if Samsung will rethink that button and the requirement to hold it for the duration of the command. And honestly about half the time I've clicked on the Bixby button, I was trying to hold my phone or adjust my volume - bad placment..Con - One better like clicking okay and yes to use these apps. Android suffers from the same thing Windows does. You have to click an extra time or 2 to get a function to set. Even when logging in right now, I may have to push the home button, then swipe up, enter a code, and then click an ok to proceed. On my iphone, I pushed the home button and let my finger rest there and I was in. The majority of system settings and apps have similar unneccessary extra selections and swipes..Con - Speech to text in voice assistants, text message or email is truly unpredictable. I did not truly appreciate how well Apple does this until I stopped using it on this phone. It is really that bad in most real life situations that I want to use it..Big Con - There is an emergency call button (it will dial 911 if you click it) that is badly placed on the unlock screen. I conciously have to avoid hitting that stupid thing 20 to 40 times a day. It's these things that seriously puts iPhone ahead of Samsung in actual usage.  I don't have issue with it there, but I need option to move it up on screen where I won't accidentally hit it. I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT HATES THIS..Big Con - Audio volume is ok for music apps but it has an annoying warning about excessive volumes damaging hearing that I want to disable forever and it won't let me. I wouldn't mind seeing the warning and have it go away in a couple of seconds, but you must interact with the warning manually. It is especially irritating because of this next big con..Con - Audio in apps are extremely low when using cabled headsets and at least some on wireless. One example is podcast apps. I have to max out the phone volume and increase my car stereo volume to hear them at the same volume of songs. I use a jabra headset when driving in my car - it's what I used to use with my iPhone and the same issue is present with it. I don't know how many apps are affected, and it may be setting related, but it is an issue out of the box..Con - Videos do not go full screen by flipping screen sideways. In almost every instance iPhone does this by default. It is not the case here - ofen it takes a click or 2 to get that to take..APPS.Pro - Multiple app stores to download products..Pro - Because android allows more access to hardware and OS, there are apps for a whole different use than what Apple apps provide. There are many apps to add functionality to the phone. The phone can go into silent mode or reduce its volume anytime you arrive at work for example. You can change your icons from developer default to marbles with the app name listed on them..Meh - Apps are mostly as functional as what IOS equivilent provides, but they aren't streamlined for ease of use. I miss my iPhone apps quite a bit..Con - Most underground app stores likely have viruses in part of their offered apps..Con - Most free apps have ads..Big Con - Unless you are willing to download apps from 'risky' locations, apps without ads are double or triple the price on Apple. I rarely see any paid for app include an ad but I see many paid for apps include apps after purchase..UNTESTED.NA - Provided headphones. They are marketed to be $100 street value but I use wireless audio and haven't had the need to test yet...And here are my suggestions for those not used to Android:..Don't do as I did. As soon as I got basics down (before I sorted out what I needed to work), I hit the store and got lost in downloading free apps. Before I knew it I had a bunch of apps I didn't remember the function for and I included a launcher that sounded soooo great.  And then I figured out what came with those downloads - apps. I was UNHAPPY for a day with an app on my home screen. It was from the launcher by the way. The launcher made me about half crazy trying to work against it. So, if you are stuck in this mode, uninstall, uninstall, uninstall. Airpush Detector is an app that can help identify sources of ads...Stay with Samsung's default touchwiz launcher at first.  A launcher gives you a look and feel to the device and determines what functions you can add and remove from the settings.  When new to android, touchwiz gives plenty to play with and see what is available and you don't get embedded ads up front...Put the settings app somewhere you can find it easily...By default, the touchwiz launcher gives you a main landing screen that has a google search field and the primary row of phone related apps you see on every screen and one seconadary row of icons that belongs to this landing screen only. When you scroll to the right, the primary row will go with the view and the secondary will go offscreen with the rest of that landing screen. The idea is that the apps on the secondary row are your most frequently used apps along with the main phone apps on the primary row. When you scroll to the screen to the right, that screen is similar to what iPhone screens look like - a grid for placing apps over a chosen background. Each time you scroll to the right you can add one of these grid screens as iPhone does. Something not found on iPhone is an app drawer. It is available from each screen, if you swipe upward on the primary row - there is an up arrow on the primary row indicating the app drawer and you can choose to keep or remove a dedicated button that opens it as well. That drawer has a default copy of every app installed on the phone. If you want one on any of the main screens, press and hold an app inside the app drawer and it will let you pull it upward out of the drawer and it will drop to whatever location you release it at. The copy will remain in the drawer unless you explicitely delete or hide it from there...If you already know you don't like the app drawer concept, you can remove it and the upward screen swipe function will go away and all installed apps will drop onto the those grid screens - just like how iPhone behaves. If you are getting lost looking for apps, go ahead and remove the app drawer now to get closer to the iPhone default setup: Settings app icon &gt; Display &gt; Home screen &gt; Home screen layout.  I suggest adding it back at a later date to see if you like it later; once there isn't so much to get used to at once...You likely are used to having a set of apps on the main row of your homescreen from whatever smart phone you come from. Change the row of apps on the primary row to match what you currently use and set those apps up for use...The timeout to black out the screen is way too fast when one is trying to figure out how to configure the phone. Go to settings and change setting not to lock if looking at screen.  Bixby can help find - just hold the button and ask to change that setting. If you have no Samsung account, you get to set up your account now...The phone is likely completely unlocked to anyone - you should set up security at some point - I suggest setting the passcode, the fingerprint scanner &amp; the iris scanner. You'll be unlocking the phone once you do this, so decide if you want to do this now or later...The phone comes with 2 app stores installed, they are Samsung Market and Google Playstore.  I do not group my apps by developer. I group them by what they do. I suggest you pull the apps out of any folders they are in and put the near each other.  I usually look in the Samsung Marker first to see if there is a version of an app developed specifically for this phone and if not, I look in Google Playstore which will be developed for android phones in general...Next get some sort of security on the phone. Most carriers will have some sort of security app pre-installed. Launch it and make sure it is set up. I also installed Avast from one of the app store due to its popularity across android forums...If you are like me, you now have lots of apps running in the background. Press the dedicated recent softkey next to the home button. It is indicated by 2 arrows making a box. You can close them all...Initially, I was getting confused by apps provided to do same thing. Select an app for each function and remove the other app..Messaging clients: I hid Messages (it wont uninstall) &amp; stayed with message+ until I could navigate the OS easily..Browsers: This is a difficult choice. Samsung Internet(purple globe) is designed to be integrated with this phones hardware and shows to be most similar to iPhone's browser for efficiency.  In my usage, it blocked sites that Chrome didn't and that I didn't feel were unsafe.  If you have no preference and gmail isn't your default form of communicating, I'd disable Chrome (no uninstall available) unless you have same issue I had. If you are tied to gmail, I'd use Chrome and hide/uninstall Internet if it'll let you...If you were using an iPhone before, Samsung has provided an app called Smart Switch to hook to your iPhone with provided hardware in the box (the one with the usb hookup adapter) and it will scan your iPhone and set up your contacts, move your photos if you have room, and find matching apps from the stores.  I'd run that at this time...Now go find a free background or theme you like in one of the stores..Select what displays on your always on display..Set up your apps and you should be set to use the phone for a bit...Once you are comfortable using all that you have set up - maybe a day or 2, set up the edge app. You'll have a better idea by that time what might be nice to have on that shortcut...Other Suggestions:.Set do not disturb on a schedule (in the settings app) if you get woken up by text messages and such at night..Block blue light with sunset (in the settings app) - supposedly reduces affects of phone screen on your sleep..Set finger scanner to swipe down to pull notifications open - honestly I dont use it, but go ahead - it's kind of cool...Note:.You cannot delete apps that are sitting on the primary apps bar - you must relocate it to the grid. Depending on app, it may not allow uninstall, but you may be able to disable and/or hide.  Worst case, make a folder and hide all unused apps in it...After a few days, research what a widget is and set one up on one of your screens - Maybe a calendar or a clock..After a few more days, research what ""edge"" apps are available to you...Some apps that I'm using:.Ad source finder- air push detector (suggested by coworker).Downloaded &amp; changed keyboard to GBoard (suggested by forums and tested well against others I tried).Ad blocker - Crystal Ad blocker (can't remember why I chose this).Pw manager - Dashlane shows up top in many reviews (you have to engage the app to set up the pw).Browser - Puffin pro (free has ads) for speed of use - but it has a drawback of memory consumption compared to other browsers.Chat client - Textra (mainly testing from high reviews).Widget - I'm using a widget called Month to put a calendar on one of my grid screens.....",26

4.0,"Great phone, Verizon compatible with a few minor bumps","September 13, 2017",1,"The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+.  It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates.  I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5...In the end it was worth the upgrade.  As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5.  I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning...Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon.  This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store...This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a ""Verizon Branded"" S8.  Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out.  After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything...Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all...Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app.  You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store.  Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me...Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8.........",7

5.0,Amazing phone,"September 17, 2017",1,"I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .)..This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy:.-Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though).-Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though).-Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself..-Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...).-You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!).-Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.).-It still allows your to insert microphone jacks..-USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.).-And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival...Some downsides on the phone:.-Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone).-Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone..-Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled..-Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though...This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional..All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all...(Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)....",6

1.0,AMOLED Screen Defects Appear After Warranty Ends,"October 21, 2017",1,"Just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. Horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. I haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  Note that if you contact Samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. Buyer beware!",13
2.0,"ok phone, cheated by samsung sales&amp;support;","November 10, 2017",0,"the phone in itself is fine. i bought this with a trade in phone so supposedly i was getting $125 for the old phone. well, a month later, samsung sales came back to say sorry, your item does not qualify for trade in so we charging you 125 dollars extra. i asked to return the s8 here as clearly this was now beyond my budget. well, you wish. they said i had only 15 days after the purchase day to return it so i am stuck now with an over priced item. i am still reporting Samsung to the Federal Trade Commission to try to resolve this issue (after all, how was i supposed to return within 15 days when they rejected the item a month later, clearly the 15 days should apply to the moment the buyer has all the final costs charged). anyways beware of the dirty tricks that samsung plays with the customer. if you come to rely on their support, you may as well be on your own.",7

1.0,"Good Phone, Atrocious Customer Service","November 29, 2017",0,"If Customer Service is important, STAY AWAY. The phone is great but if it needs service, don't count on Samsung to do what they promise. My phone arrived with a scratch in the Gorilla Glass. I talked to a Samsung rep who said they would for sure repair that and we arranged to have my phone sent in. They ask you to send in the charger and cable too, so I did. After a week, I received a $300 quote for the repair I was told would be no charge. By the end of the call, they agreed to fix the scratched glass. Another week went by and I received my phone completely unrepaired and missing my charger and cable. I called back and the rep I spoke to said the repair was approved but somehow it was never authorized so they just sent my phone back to me. After further discussion, they PROMISED to take care of the screen and asked me to send in my phone. I trusted their promise and sent in my phone. After two weeks, I received my phone back, again unrepaired. Another call to customer service later and they couldn't tell me whether they were simply inept or if they had just lied to me. The experience has left me sour for not only Samsung phones but for all other Samsung products as well. As far as I'm concerned, if it's a Samsung, it's not going into my house.",4
3.0,"Excellent phone, but no replacable battery","August 4, 2017",1,"Excellent phone.  The only three things keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating are:..1) No replaceable battery.  If the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset.  Also, when the battery will no longer hold a charge you are SOL (And this will happen sooner or later...it will force you to buy a new expensive phone even if a new battery would fix the issue at a much reduced cost)..2) Bixby...just plain annoying!  The button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes Bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations..3) Curved glass.  While this looks sleek and ""sexy"" it is kinda annoying.  If somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone.  Also makes screen protectors a lot more expensive and elaborate...Can't argue much with the price though, much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else.......",10
5.0,Best phone I've ever owned,"November 11, 2017",0,"I'm going to start out this review by stating that I have basically hated the Galaxy S phones since they've come out.  I loved my old Samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to Android, I just couldn't get into them.  I read how amazing the Super AMOLED screen was, and I thought it was garbage.  It was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off.  The UI was cartoony and had weird colors.  Over the years, though, Samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their Android skin, and after all this time I can finally say that they've sold me...The feel:..The first thing I noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels.  It's crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass.  It has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium.  It feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble.  With the infinity screen it (and its brothers the S8+ and Note 8) is easily the most attractive phone I've ever seen, a departure from the older Galaxy S phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me...While the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand.  While it's still a stretch, it's more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive.  Speaking of the on-screen keys, I've never been a fan until now.  They work well and the home ""button"" even has a vibrating ""click"" when you press it in, which I like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot...The physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which I don't like, and the Bixby button (which I'll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find...As much as I like the design, this phone NEEDS a case.  I don't mean that as a bad thing, although for some people I'm sure it will be.  It's delicate.  The all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you'll find reading reviews and watching drop tests.  The edge display detects accidental touches on occasion.  The volume keys are too clicky.  The phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop.  A case solves all of these problems.  Even if I didn't work in construction (which I do), I would put a case on this phone.  I personally went with the Spigen Rugged Armor <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Case-Spigen®-Rugged-Armor-Galaxy-S8-Case-Cover-with-Resilient-Shock-Absorption-and-Carbon-Fiber-Design-for-Galaxy-S8-2017-Black-565CS21609/dp/B06XNNJ4KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Galaxy S8 Case, Spigen® [Rugged Armor] Galaxy S8 Case Cover with Resilient Shock Absorption and Carbon Fiber Design for Galaxy S8 (2017) - Black- 565CS21609</a> case, which I highly recommend.  There's even a Youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever...Software:..For years Samsung's TouchWiz was bloated and ugly.  I hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the Super AMOLED screen).  But now, with the paring down of bloat, it's finally become useable.  A while back Samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and I'm glad they did.  I was able to change all of the default Samsung apps and menus into the black shades that I love so much.  You can even replace the icons with a different themes, although I ended up using Nova Launcher with some icons I had bought for it...I like the way Samsung has set up their apps.  They are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features.  Probably my least favorite is the Gallery, although my complaints are minor.  My issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file.  The little overlays that tell you if it's a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures.  But the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use.  Everything runs fast and I even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (I had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me...There is still bloat though.  Samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of Google's, which aggravates me.  It would be fine if I planned on sticking to the Samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but I'm not even close to making that commitment.  I still use all of Google's services, because I can use them on any Android phone.  You get Samsung Calendars, Samsung Health, Samsung Pay (which I'll elaborate more on), Samsung backup, and others.  It's mostly not a chore to use Google's features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you're using their Google equivilants...To be honest I didn't even try Bixby.  Google Assistant is more than I need, and I don't like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for Samsung's digital assistant.  Fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that.  The button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable Bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone...The Galaxy S8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the Edge shortcuts.  This is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with.  There are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end I didn't see the need for one more thing on my screen.  That being said, I think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature...Samsung Pay is a feature I was surprised by.  My phone came with a promotional $50 credit via Samsung Pay so I was obligated to use it.  The first time I tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn't do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen.  I calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment.  I got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way.  I've used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with Samsung Pay.  As cool as the first two times were, I didn't appreciate looking like a fool while I waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot...Hardware:..Another feature I was surprised by was the fingerprint reader.  I found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler.  It's very quick and let me log into my Wells Fargo and Paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc.  Yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera.  However, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone.  Once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue...Battery life so far has been great.  This is the seventh Android phone I've owned, and I don't recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life.  My galaxy S5 I briefly owned (used, to replace an LG G3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors.  This one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today's world that's the most I hope for from a cell phone.  I do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime.  The battery is not removable however so keep that in mind...I've never tried wireless charging before, but I did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and I had to buy new cables anyway for the new USB C standard, so I snagged a wireless charger from Amazon.  I didn't use the Samsung charger or cable so I'm sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead.  This works well for me for charging overnight, but you can't use your phone while it's lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses...Call quality has been wonderful.  The volume of the ear speaker is actually more than I need, which is a good thing.  I'd rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder.  The external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way.  I didn't get any complaints on speakerphone mode...The screen almost needs its own catagory.  As I stated, for years I've hated Super AMOLED.  I don't get how people thought the early screens looked good.  The saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed.  But finally, with this phone, I feel that the colors and saturation are perfect.  The screen is super bright too, and in fact Samsung's auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first Android phone I've ever had auto-brightness turned on with.  The resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which I recommend not messing with.  You can turn it up to 4k, but it's not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly.  As it is, pictures and text are extremely clear.  Everything just looks so great on this screen, I find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it.  The infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides.  The phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it's locked.  The brightness is turned down so that you don't get screen burn-in, and I found that I liked this feature, which didn't seem to affect battery drain...The camera is one of the reasons I bought this phone.  I've heard for a few years now that Apple and Samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality.  In practice, I'm mostly happy with my choice.  In well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful.  Colors are great and they've very clear.  Burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second.  Low light shots were a mixed bag, though.  The lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring.  This is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but I honestly expected this phone camera to do better.  Perhaps it's a setting I need to enable, but as of right now I was a little disappointed.  However, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, I suppose I don't have much choice but to accept it...Summary:..I know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person's life and I feel like I needed to share my full experience to buyers...Overall I love this phone.  There are no major issues with it and using it is a joy.  I'm sure it's partly the new phone effect, but I find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so I can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance.  It has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory Samsung bloat, but so far it's been a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend it.",3
5.0,the phone is brilliant. Sharp display,"September 14, 2017",1,"Ordered this device while Harvey was ongoing. There was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays...The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range...Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs...The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps...The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens...I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!.",5
4.0,"One of the best available (compared with iphone 6s, LG G6 and Huawei Mate 9)","September 29, 2017",0,"UPDATE 12/22/17: My phone is still going strong and looks pretty much the same as when I first got it. I'm still using the same Speck Candyshell Grip case and same liquid install screen protector. They are in great shape and providing enough protection tor my phone. The glitchy stuff seems to have mostly been fixed after an update. I have the unlocked version. Facebook app has been sucking big time, so I mostly access facebook through a browser and only use the facebook app to post pictures...When picking a phone over the past few months, I tried iphone 6s(hated the locked down feel and it had major battery drain with my music app that could not be fixed, so that was a deal breaker), Huawei Mate 9(Has a good camera, good battery life when battery drain isn't happening, but it isn't optimized for google apps and gets battery drain every couple weeks so I had to reset it all the time, ridiculous), LG G6(Great front camera, loved the wide-angle option, terrible front camera circa 2013 and bad connectivity with my Honda UPlay and Google play music)......And, now the Samsung S8, I have had it for a month now. It takes pretty good pictures. The Mate 9 had more detailed pics, but S8 takes better low-light photos in my experience. I'd say they are about tied for front cameras. The selfie camera is slightly better with the Mate 9 than the S8 because you can adjust more on the Mate 9 and the focus seems to be a little better when people stay in the background of a photo and not side by side. I prefer the Mate 9 photo gallery, too. It's easier to select photos to share. The speakers are a bit quiet and not as nice sounding on the S8 verses the Mate 9. Mate 9 has loud speakers with stereo option when it's side, but the S8 sounds acceptable and is much improved over my old Samsung S3. It's quieter than the LG G6 as well and comparable to the iPhone 6s. I heard the newer iPhones have stereo speakers and get pretty loud, though. But, new model iPhones are too expensive for me and offer less features than android phones at a similar price...So far, the Samsung S8 is still the better phone, it's more reliable, it does not have battery drain and the battery life is consistently allowing 6-7 hrs screen on time if all used in one day or around 5 hrs if used over 2 days. I do have to restart my phone sometimes because of minor glitches here and there. Not often, just a couple times a week, so no biggie. It does have a buggy connection with Google Play Music and Honda Uplay, but it still plays the music, it just causes the menu to flash on and off, but it's ignorable and better than not working like the G6, Mate 9 didn't have this problem, but the battery drain still makes Mate 9 a loser for me. I prefer the smaller feel of the S8. It feels very comfortable to hold as compared to the phablet phones like Mate 9. Samsung S8 has many accessories available to it that Mate 9 did not offer in the US due to lack of popularity. S8 has a car charger option, battery pack charger option, and many cases and screen protector options. I tried a couple cases and found the Speck Candyshell Grip case to be the best, I like that it gives some protection around the edge part of the screen while still leaving you full functionality and it's not bulky. I dropped my phone a couple times in the case from a couple feet up and the phone is unharmed..I used an IQ shield liquid install screen protector and that works well even though it takes longer to install. No issues with it coming loose until now. I don't like the curved phone screen, but the Samsung S8 is one of the best phones available and beats out the competition in my opinion. I got mine for close to $600 with tax, I don't think I would pay more than that. Watch for sales. It's been on sale many times since it's release. I would not recommend buying from Samsung directly. I bought one S8 from Samsung and returned it before going back and buying it again elsewhere. The return through Samsung took a month and I had to contact them a second time before they finally processed the return with some message about getting lost at the facility or something, but they still have a note about receiving it. Amazon is a good place to buy from as long as you buy directly through Amazon and not through a third party. It's nice that they give you a 30 day return period. That's the longest period I have seen anywhere...If you want an Android phone, Samsung is still the best available in the states, in my opinion. There are more nice phones available overseas, but you want to have a US warranty, easily available accessories, etc, that leaves you with Samsung, LG, Google, and iPhone for the most part. One big negative with Samsung is that screen is SUPER expensive to replace. I would not get a Samsung S8 if you are rough on your phones. There is an S8 active available through ATT and it's supposed to release for other carriers and maybe unlocked in the future from what I read. Maybe Amazon will get it, too?.",3
1.0,Buyer beware: this phone is too fragile,"September 26, 2017",1,"It's been a month and I already regret the purchase. My screen cracked from a 2 foot fall, and with a protective case on it. I've never seen a phone this fragile.",8
1.0,Phone screen designed to break sooner or later,"November 7, 2017",0,"This phone is very fragile, I accidentally dropped it 1 ft high and it broke in 3 different places. It is tough to find a good screen protector that protects the phone and not degrade screen sensitivity. The setting to increase touch sensitivity which was available in the S5 is now gone so there is no way around this problem. The thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. Either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later. It is as if Samsung intentionally designed the phone so that the screen will break (so they can sell more $200 'gorilla' glass screen'?) Other gimmicks are the 'Bixby' app which pops up constantly if you swipe the phone unintentionally in the wrong direction, and the edge screen which accidentally activates some menus while holding it. So you will have to try to hold this slippery phone by avoiding the front edges which increases the chance of dropping and breaking it.",7

1.0,Buyer beware - counterfeit!,"October 17, 2017",1,"The phone we received was a counterfeit. If you have doubts if it is a fake, do some research.

I did some things like, tap on the back a see if it is plastic or glass and look at the size of the bevel of the phone. Buyer beware!",13
5.0,Best phone out this year at any price...,"October 9, 2017",1,"The best phone at any price right now.  I'm looking forward to next year when I may go for the Samsung Note.  I was a ten year iPhone user and finally lost patience with Tim Cook and his mediocre product development.  He's no Steve Jobs, not by a long shot...  This is the best phone and still has a proper headphone jack.  Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds, I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack.  With Apple and now Google Pixel phones committing to what is obviously a very controversial move, it seems like there may be a bigger agenda.  Maybe one of you software engineers can figure out what is the huge advantage of taking away a feature of the phone without adding to it.  Seems like maybe there is some larger reason, like maybe the bluetooth  headsets allow the companies to track you differently.  Maybe the headsets communicate with every wifi device in the world and tell them what you are doing.  I just don't get why they go out of their way to remove it, when it obviously still fits.  Samsung did it, but these other companies can't?  Got to be more to it.",3

1.0,I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I'd previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products,"November 30, 2017",0,"I feel the need to warn people--do not buy this phone. I have been a lifelong Samsung Galaxy customer and was very excited when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge about a year and a half ago. This phone is a hunk of junk and Samsung is wrong to continue selling it. Do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there  are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, SD card corruption--the list goes on. My problems began about three months in to having the phone. So much money was spent on it that I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I'd previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. I took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. This took care of the notorious ""pink line"" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. The line returned in all it's obnoxious and infuriating glory. Again, I could go on endlessly with other complaints--but trust me you and anyone who glances at your phone won't be able to ignore the screen problem...I will not be buying a Samsung product again..",4

With the last Apple device being the iPhone 4, I gave it a go with Android. Initially hesitant to use Android starting with the HTC Evo, but eventually after testing out Samsung Galaxy line, I decided it's worth a shot. One thing I love about the S8 is the Infinity Display. Love how responsive it is, how thin the phone is, and how less susceptible the phone is to scratches. If you're looking for a tempered glass screen protector with this phone,.

5.0,Love the new design,"September 15, 2017",1,"Amazon was having a $200 off deal on this when I purchased, which... is really good for a new phone, actually. I moved to this from the S5, and it's a big change. Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly...My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case...My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now...",2
5.0,Unlocked works with ANY carrier!,"July 25, 2017",0,"This is an amazing phone. I bought it outright and had it unlocked immediately on a CDMA plan. Took a trip and my carrier wasn't anywhere in the area. Found a local store that said only one was. He sold me a pay as you go SIM, which allowed me to do texting, but I blocked all the rest, and it worked perfectly. Just as promised by Samsung, it is broadcast band independent!",5
2.0,"If you enjoy owning a good phone case protector and screen protection, then stay away from these curved-screen phones.","January 30, 2018",0,"I bought my Galaxy S8 directly through the Verizon store, but I need to vent here on Amazon to warn others about he Galaxy S8 and even the new Galaxy S9's that are coming out very soon... Overall, the Galaxy S8 is a great flagship phone, it's fast, and offers amazing features. The biggest downfall, and why I'm likely to return it and grab a Pixel 2 phone, is a severe lack of good-quality aftermarket phone accessories that properly protect the phone. I'm used to going out and buying an Otterbox Defender, or a LifeProof for FULL phone and screen protection, and being happy about it. Unfortunately, if you look up the reviews for the Lifeproof or the Otterbox for the Galaxy S8, you will see just how much of a difficult time the aftermarket accessories providers have had with trying to FULL protect this Galaxy S8 phone because of its curved screen...Because of the curved screen on this phone, it is VERY hard to find ANYONE who makes a fantastic all-around screen protector or case for the Galaxy S8. Sure many people SELL cases and screen protectors for this S8 phone, but if you actually read most of the reviews on the aftermarket protective devices for the Galaxy S8, you'll see that the curved screen causes all kinds of issues such as killing the functionality of using the heart-rate sensor, or fingerprint reader, or the touch screen not working properly or as well as it should because of a curved screen protector goes on top of it. The curved screen on these Samsung phones, in my own humble opinion, is a terrible fad that needs to go away. It reminds me of when Samsung and others were also trying to push their hardest to sell curved LCD/LED TV's after the 3D-TV push to the American market failed due to impatient TV manufacturers waiting for 3D and curved screens to take-hold...When I bought my Galaxy S7 I purposely opted for the NON-curved screen because I was on the fence back then too. Now that Samsung has completely forced everyone into an ""all-or-none"" scenario where I can only buy a regular-sized curved screen, or a bigger-sized curved screen. After having tried this Galaxy S8 for a week now, buying the Otterbox and Spigen screen protector along with some tempered glass protectors that kept popping off because they only stay secured to the curved screen via a thin glue that is applied ONLY around the edges of the glass screen protector, and then trying the Lifeproof Fre case, and then trying the Ghostek waterproof case...I've just about lost my mind. The curved screen on this phone has NO good product that I can find where there is not a gap between the screen protector and the phones actual screen, making lots of texting and typing a major pain. The cases all seem to hinder functionality of fingerprint and heart-beat sensors and mess with the front AND back camera lighting a little, and they muffle speaker phone calls a bit... I could live with all the downsides EXCEPT for the touchscreen issues. If you cant touch the phone properly and make accurate presses, then the phone is useless and fails in its biggest goal as being a smart phone. Add insult to injury, every case I've tried still still leaves the curved area of the LCD screen unprotected (otherwise you wouldnt be able to use tabs or the curved screen functions)...but because these cases never properly protect the edge of the curved screen, it means that there is always a possibly of dropping your Galaxy S8 and it lands at such an angle where the edge of the curved screen hits first, and this will easily cause a broken or cracked screen. Look at the reviews for various Galaxy S8 cases and screen protectors on Amazon photos, and you'll see many broken-hearted people who thought their phone would be safe from a 4-foot drop onto the floor...These curved screens need to go away. Until I can get a FLAT-SCREENED phone with no dumb curves from Samsung (flat screens make it easier to get third-party accessory support for protective cases that actually work properly) then I'm done with Samsung after this recent headache. It's too bad too, because I've been a loyal Galaxy user since the Galaxy S2, and I've owned the S3, S4, S5, S6, AND S7 and was always very happy with the case and screen protector options that I could buy in the past. With this Galaxy S8, I'm almost certain it will end up broken with the S8 cases and screen protectors that are currently available on the market. Therefore, the Galaxy S8 goes back to the store and I'll have to buy a different Android phone. Samsung, please cater to all of your customers while keeping phone protection in mind. I'm sure that Samsung loves broken phones while selling replacements with all of the accidental warranty services out these days...but I dont want to buy a $700 to $1000 phone only to have crappy physical protection for it due to a silly curved screen. A curved screen isn't worth the potential losses and breakages to me...Seriously, what the heck...",2
5.0,"Wow, it's great","November 27, 2017",1,"This is quite a phone..It's extremely fast compared to our older Samsung S4..It's unlocked, so even when the kind folks at Verizon looked at me as if I was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the Verizon network, I knew it would (having read the reviews at Amazon) and I just told them to produce the free small sims card.  (Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.).If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone.  The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already..One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone.  You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps.  Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference..I can't get over how fast this phone surfs the internet (I use Firefox) and how nicely photos are auto-arranged by date..",2

5.0,AMAZING and so worth it!!!,"August 31, 2017",0,BUY A CASE!!! If you read the bad reviews they all hate the phone because they said it is slippery and fragile!! My only advise is to buy a $20 case and the protection plan! Totally worth it! I bought mine a month ago and it is the best piece of technology I have ever owned. I am a HUGE Samsung fan and this is by far my favorite and has not disappointed me yet. This phone is amazing. It definitely beats out its Apple competitors and if you do not believe me then do your research because this phone is unprecedented. I LOVE it and it is worth every last penny! It will last for years to come and it is built to resist shatters and drops and it is even water resistant for up to 30 minutes under 5 feet of water!!! It is smooth to the touch and is extremely fast!! The memory usage is fantastic and the features it comes with are great. I recommend this to anyone buying a new phone...it is everything seen in the commercials and more. It has Bixby on it and she can do ANYTHING... I often use her feature to remind me where I parked or turn the lights off!!! Amazing technology and great phone!!!,2
5.0,"Unlocked S8 (SM-G950U1, US Version) from a big box retailer","October 11, 2017",0,"So many other reviewers have posted exemplary write-ups detailing the features, benefits, photos of the S8.  I won't even try to compare. All I can tell you is that I needed to replace my 3-year-old Galaxy Alpha, so when the Galaxy S8 went on sale over Labor Day weekend, I walked into a big box retailer (whose name rhymes with ""guest guy"") intending to buy one of the lesser priced prior year models like the G7. However when I walked into the display area, the S8 winked at me, it was love at first sight, I was stunned and floored by the beauty, grace, forward-looking design, advanced features including VR, and vibration control video camera performance that reminded me (in my simplistic estimation) of Hollywood steadicam, a far cry from my prior Alpha's performance in that regard.  (Plus, simply, when it comes to Android, where obsolescence unfortunately happens rather quickly, newer is better, because it gives you longer usable life.)  I bought.  I haven't looked back.  The two of us have been joined at the hip (literally) for almost 2 months, as I mated it with a very inexpensive, minimal size holster case that visually recedes out of the way to allow the stunning beauty of this phone to shine (while continuing to buffer it from shocks)...Phone setup was a breeze, as I merely unplugged the micro SIM from my Galaxy Alpha, plugged it into the S8, and my cellular carrier was auto-configured by the S8, so you really can't hope for anything cleaner than that. Plus the simplified migration utility that came with the S8  copied over my files and photos, my contacts lists and more, from my prior phone...I spent a fair amount of time optimizing app power use.  The S8 now uses minimal power while I'm out and about, and at night it takes no more than a few minutes to bring to full charge again, ready for next day...A chief buying criteria for me was camera performance. I found amazing praise in the comparative reviews published at GSMArena, a prominent factor in my willingness to purchase the S8.  Camera performance matches or exceeds reviewers' expectations...Unlock methods:  fingerprint / face scan / iris scan / voice scan / nearby device detection / draw pattern / type a PIN.  (I've used face, fingerprint, pattern.)  Fingerprint wasn't working for a while but Samsung fixed with a firmware push (Nov 2018)...I'm a guy who has consciously avoided the phablet phenomenon as I can't imagine carrying a massive hunk of hardware wherever I go. The S8 has surprised me with its incredibly large viewable area, while still maintaining a manageably slim and narrow carrying profile, the perfect fusion of function, beauty and utility, in my opinion...Read some of the other reviews, see it for yourself, and allow yourself to believe that there truly can be such an exceptional piece of engineering...So far, it's been a joy ride...",1

The phone is light, sleek, feels good in hand, feels good in pocket, is more sturdy than I had thought, is fast, great photos, great interface and has an expandable SD slot (which my nexus didn't have, so, improvement)...The biggest caveat I've had so far is the Bixby button. I'm glad that Samsung has added a ""disable"" feature, but remapping that button would be great. Beyond that, love the phone :).",2
2.0,Great phone and battery life but its simply too fragile and too expensive to repair!!,"September 6, 2017",0,"Screen is EXTREMELY fragile.  Featuewise and style, this phone has everything.  But the screen cracks from simple drops.  In my case it went from my lap, bounced off my foot and flat on the floor.  Picked up and had multiple fractures throughout the screen.  The local repair shop wanted $400 just to repair it!  Sorry Samsung. Build a beautiful full featured phone that can take at least a little drop!  I would not recommend this unless you are willing to shell out extra for a good extended warranty.  From what I've learned, its not ""IF"" the screen will crack its a matter of ""WHEN"".",3
2.0,Most Fragile Phone On the Market,"September 3, 2017",0,"This is a great phone in terms of its power and UI... Pretty much any phone in this price point is going to be amazing, and it definitely fits the bill in terms of specs and performance...However, it is probably the most fragile phone ever made.  I have never broken a phone in my life, and I drop my phone as much as the next person.  You can tell the second you hold this phone that it is amazingly fragile.  The whole thing is made of Gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily.  Crazy that this design was actually approved, I don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic.  Any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market...The design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket.  I can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (I am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it IE breaks), but I had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when I sat it immediately started to slip out.  I think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones.  I have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment I put this phone in my pocket...My phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact.  The fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least.  Shame on me for not having the case on it (I literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case I purchased was at home)...  However, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... Again a drop no more than 2.5 feet...Insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or I guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long.  My S5 fell 2 stories and didn't get a scratch. This phone fell 2 feet and spider cracked to a point where I need to get it repaired.  One of the most important aspects of a cell phone is its durability and ability to handle everyday life and people where accidents happen at one point or another is guaranteed.  The fact you have to treat this phone with the delicacy of an infant makes it almost a burden to own...Between the failings of the S7 and the beyond poor durability of the S8, this lifelong Android user may switch to Iphone my next phone purchase a few years down the line..",3

The Pixel 2 doesn't have a headphone jack so I opted for the s8. This is a great phone! I'm sure there are more detailed reviews out there, but overall, I love this phone. Smooth interface, beautiful form factor, headphone jack, no problems using all my apps. I like the unusual screen shape, which is a bit longer than typical, which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super-wide phone. It does overheat more easily than my earlier Nexus 5 (to be fair, I accidentally took it into a sauna so this is an unusual use case) and there are times when the touch screen isn't quite as responsive as I'd like, but it's a solid phone for the price. I've used multiple apps and functions, hooked it up to Bluetooth speakers and headphones (regular and Bluetooth), connected to multiple WiFi ports, etc. And it's handled all of that pretty comfortably...It's slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case. I bought a super thin Humixx case (red!) that I like, and no problems..",1
2.0,She loved the look and feel of the 8+ and at ...,"August 28, 2017",0,"Wife recently purchased thru ATT authorized store. She loved the look and feel of the 8+ and at first, it worked great. However, within a few days it stopped working, displaying no network available error code on screen. Problem is, we were at home and my phone, an older Samsung S4 Active, also with ATT was working so there definitely was ATT network service available. Turned the phone on and off a few times, still no signal. Finally, using my phone, called ATT customer service. Forty five mins later with numerous instructions from ATT Agt, using my phone, finally managed to get her phone up and running with Agt stating he had found an error on the part of the store sales clerks initial registration process. Ok, fine. Fast forward 3-4 days later, same problem + phone was shutting itself off for no reason. Back to customer service using her phone this time. It would not allow her to make any outside phone calls or text messages, giving same no network available error code, yet it would allow her to dial customer service using 611, however. Another long conversation with ATT phone rep again who, this time suggested taking phone back to store and have the sim card replaced. Phone was now 16 days old since purchase. Did exactly that and store clerk changed out sim card. Still didn't work. Tried 2nd sim card on same visit and it didn't work either.  Store clerk then erased electronic serial number in their system, re-typed same ser # back in, reinserted 2nd sim card, rebooted phone and it finally worked but only for about 4 days before same problem occurred again. Problem is, she had to go out of town to a funeral and needed a dependable phone. She was so frustrated by now, she had ATT store switch sim card back over to her old iphone 5, which at least had always been dependable, if not very exciting. Thus she was safe on the trip, at least as far as having a phone she could count on again. When she returned home from funeral a few days later, she immediately called ATT customer service, once again explaining her problem. Another 30 min conversation and they now wanted to send her a refurbished phone replacement for a phone she was paying a new phone charge for, not a refurb price. She refused the refurb and the ATT rep finally told her he was making note in file, recommending the selling ATT store take it back. She also called Samsung directly and their rep told her to take it back to store and have them do a factory reset before sending it in to Samsung for warranty repair. Samsung rep was sure that would more than likely fix the problem. So she took the S8+ phone back to ATT store where she bought it, demanding a new phone, since they couldn't seem to fix it. They refused and in stead, sent her sixty miles down the road to an Atlanta Corporate ATT store, the Mgr of the selling store stating he was sure the Corporate store would replace it, what with the ATT phone rep recommending same. Corporate store mgr. was indignant, rude and emphatically refused, stating the selling store should replace it. By now, after several ATT dog and pony shows, failure on their part to do the right thing, my wife had had enough, drove sixty miles back to selling store, dumped the non working S8+ phone as well as the Samsung 8in Tablet they had also talked her into buying with the S8+, demanded a refund for all and a receipt for the returned equipment. ATT store clerk didn't have the authority to do an immediate credit, stating she would have to get the owner to do it over the next few days. Seven days go by with no credit on her acct so she now drives back to store, talks with the clerk again, who immediately credits her acct and credit card for all eqpt. Store clerk admits that this was 3rd Samsung S8+ returned within the last week for similar problems. Meanwhile, a few days later a Samsung factory rep comes by this ATT authorized store, poo poo's the apparent S8+'s problems, stating that it was just probably a bad batch of S8 phones, with no other explanation. Well, now my wife feels pretty much snake bit by Samsung and ATT over this uncalled for ordeal and is in all probability going to change to Verizon or some other carrier and I am sure, by now you have surmised she will not be purchasing a Samsung anything. She's too scared of them and what appears to be a lack of current quality control on Samsung's part compared to their good reputation in the past. Having been an ATT customer for more than ten yrs, she was very surprised and disappointed to learn of ATT's apathy and argumentative nature when failing to back up their phone with proper service after the sale. Additionally, I have been an ATT cell phone customer on my line since 1989(formerly BellSouth) and we are long time Direct TV customers. After seeing how she was treated I am also considering looking elsewhere for a different carrier and equipment, after continuously being their customer for over 28 yrs. Any company and any carrier can have problems. It's how they handle those problems that either insures brand loyalty or causes you to look elsewhere. All they had to do was to do the right thing to start with and give her a new phone that worked. Having refused to do that, what can we possibly expect from them in the future. We are currently paying almost $300.00 a month to ATT for our phone and Direct TV service. Even that did not motivate them to replace the phone, a phone which at the time was less than a month old. We sincerely hope your experience with both ATT and the Samsung S8+ phone is a better one than hers was. My phone is overdue for an upgrade but living thru her experience causes me great pause in considering any new Samsung product, inspite of fact that I have had my S4 Active for several yrs with no problems. I have never looked at another cell phone network provider in all my yrs of ATT service but I now feel compelled to at least see what they can provide.",10

5.0,This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek,"December 6, 2017",0,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!..Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home’ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible...This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ‘Home’ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!..The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR...When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I’ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!..Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ‘Talk and Surf’ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it’s a toss up!..As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and haven’t gone back!   ..",1

5.0,Wow,"November 2, 2017",0,"I can not say enough about this phone. It is as perfect as a company has done creating the perfect smartphone for me...This phone is PERFECT in my hand. Its screen is big but you wouldn't be able to tell because it is in such a small footprint. The phone is light. The worst thing about the design is how slippery it is. But a skin or case will fix that.The bezelless display makes it look leagues above every phone out there other then the Pixel 2, Essential Phone, iPhone X and LG V30. To me however the iPhone X and the S8 are tied aesthetically. They both represent the next generations of what is a smartphone. I almost bought a LG G6 before I even held this phone and thank god I didn't buy it. It doesn't compare aesthetically at all. I can list many reasons why this phone is better then all phones other then the Note 8. The V30 is debatable. And the iPhone X isn't available to the masses yet...The screen is AMAZING. Which everyone knows Sammy Mobile creates the best screens around. However, I came from a Note 5 to this thing and could instantly see the difference. Which is crazy because I didn't think the screen could get any better at a QHD resolution (this screen is only QHD+ because of the 16:9 aspect ratio)...At first I thought I would hate the aspect ratio. I love squarish phones so much and prefer my displays to be more square then rectangle. But I actually got used to it fast. Content on this looks so good with that aspect ratio. Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Video and the native Samsung video app all support a zoom in function. At first I was thinking this would be terrible because it would look stretched and things would be missing I needed to see. But no. They did an AMAZING job with the zoom feature. It's the reason I was finally sold on this aspect ratio. With out it I would have never gotten this phone...The cameras are amazing. The pixel is the only one that compares. Even the iPhone X looks night and day compared to this phone. It may be preference but shots from this phone are so much better imo...I waited a month before I wrote this review to see if the phone would start slowing down or stuttering. Nope! I run a launcher and a custom notification shader and my phone doesn't even seemed bothered. My Note 5 slowed down and sputtered when I customized the heck out of it. My S8+? No problem...The fingerprint scanner, iris scanner and facial recognition are all amazing. I have used them all and had no problems. Yes photos can trick facial recognition. However I am way more worried about a stranger robbing me or stealing it then I am of someone I know taking it. So facial recognition to me, has gotten a bad rep on this phone. As well as the fingerprint scanner. I pull out my phone conveniently with my finger in the same spot as the fingerprint scanner. So to me this design works. When I am using it two handed I just slide my left hand up and it really isn't that bad. But it is the biggest complaint on this phone. That says A LOT!..Battery life has been phenomenal. I crank it to max brightness. Wifi is usually on, NFC and bluetooth. I am still averaging like 4-5 1/2 screen on time...With a bezelless gorgeous 2K HDR screen, 4 gb Ram, Samsung Pay, the cameras, the security features (Samsung Knox, Pass, Secure Folder and the various biometric locks ), the light skin over Android, the specs that future proof it (LTE-A/LTE+, Bluetooth 5.0), big battery with great longevity (battery cycle count a lot higher then all phones before it) and wireless charging, HEADPHONE Jack, exedra exedra this is as perfect as a cell phone as you can get imo. Front facing stereo speakers are the only missing feature I can think of. But even then the speaker on this is really nice...As you can tell I love this phone. Probably my favorite peice of tech since I got my iPad Pro 9.7. Definitely by this. If you don't get a V30, Note 8 or iPhone X instead if that's your thing...Easiest 5/5 rating I have ever given...",0

5.0,Top of the line phone for those attendees of Church Android - don't read if you attend Church iPhone.,"December 7, 2017",0,"I bought this S8 phone directly from Samsung as they were having a big sale just before Thanksgiving, plus they were giving $400 rebates on my old phone (a Samsung S7 I purchased from Verizon).  My old S7 was in great condition, but ... it was locked into Verizon, and despite what their offices will tell you, it's difficult to buy a SIM chip overseas to purchase service in order to avoid Verizon's high cost international plans.  When the phone arrived, I put in a new 64mb memory chip, enabled Wifi, logged into my Gmail account, and almost immediately Google started sending my apps to the new phone.  I spent an hour or two recreating my pages, and then the dreaded moment arrived - time to move the Verizon SIM from the old to the new, and either go online or call Verizon to associate the new S8 with my old SIM/phone number.  But ... amazingly, within 30 seconds of installing the SIM, the S8 became fully operational and was using my phone number!  Easy, peasy.  No logging into Verizon, wading thru their Customer Svc dept - nada.  It just worked!  So, how do I like the new S8?  Well, I could do without the curved glass, and don't like doing without the home button and the quick unlocking of the phone, but ... the battery life seems to be longer, although it's still a bit early.  Am finding that if I'm going to be away from electrical power it's best to disable the biggest battery hog of all time - Facebook.  It doesn't hurt to disable it, as it comes roaring back when you open it, but while in disabled mode it's not constantly polling the Mother Ship and drawing the battery down.  Oh, and the camera seems to be a wash versus the S7.  At some point, and maybe we've reached it - smartphones will have a level of perfection which - for all practical purposes - can't be exceeded.  Sorta like PC's.  About the only thing Samsung and Apple can do, IMHO, is to compete on the basis of price.  Tis inevitable.  Look at what's happened to the cost of laptops and desktops.",1
4.0,Not as fragile as you might thing being all glass,"September 4, 2017",0,"I like the phone in general its an amazingly dense piece of technology.  One feature in particular I was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone.  Ride with GPS app can keep accurate topography on my rides.  I have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying.  I removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when I took the phone from my pocket or just whenever I picked it up to do something else.  The bicycle mount that I use with it also would press that button.  The moto X touch free voice assistant is superior to the button...I'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me.  its cool but I  think I'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider...The VR viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what I was used to with MotoX phones.  Although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and I have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix.  I'm having a little buyers remorse right now.  Turns out that since I am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on Ebay.  Packing it up to send away for that tomorrow.  5 - 7 business day estimated turn around.  The S8 Active is interesting but more than 2X the price.  Given my usage profile, bulkier and more durable would be an acceptable trade off...Update on the repair:  it went smooth, I was billed as expected and got the phone back in a few days.  THEN I drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact.  Just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass...Full disclosure, I did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where I was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier..  Given that it is front and back glass, its not as fragile as you might think.  Still, its glass, so dropping it on a rock doesn't end well and the direct bonded OLED + touch + 3D glass assembly is not cheap to replace when it happens.",0
2.0,"Excellent hardware, crappy Samsung Bloatware","August 14, 2017",0,"Excellent hardware but the Samsung software could have been written better by a sophomore computer science major...The Samsung Bloatware should be uninstallable by the end user. This is my first Samsung phone and probably my last. I bought two because after being an Android purist with Nexus and HTC devices, I figured I would give them a try. I am really disappointed with the Galaxy Software and store. I love Google photos but the camera app keeps forcing the Samsung app on me. I gave it a two star for the software and lack of ability to uninstall most of it. You can disable some apps but they are usually back at reboot. Even with all of my Google app store credits from survey rewards, this will probably push me over the edge to go to iPhone. Samsung, please get your crap together and fix this software abomination..",1
5.0,Beautiful powerful waterproof device.,"November 11, 2017",1,"Hardware is top notch. The phone is impressively powerful and the beautiful screen makes using it a joy. Music fans will love the SD card support and 3.5mm jack. (Yes, it's still able to store your old massive collection of MP3s AND you can enjoy it with your expensive wired headphones!).Battery lasts the day (unless you're in a cell deadspot) and will get you through the night if you do a rapid top up around noon..The unit is mostly waterproof and will survive in the rain or shower (both tested) but it won't be much use under water and probably won't survive anything much deeper than a bathtub..Software might not be to everyone's liking but it's the usual Android system underneath so you can change it however you like..Only real downside is that it's so pleasant to use I don't use my expensive PC much anymore..",1
4.0,Losing the physical home key and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back near the camera lens was a little annoying at first,"August 13, 2017",0,"Definitely a noticeable improvement in speed from the S7; it seems snappier. Losing the physical home key and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back near the camera lens was a little annoying at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly. Even though the physical home key is gone, there is still a satisfying tactile ""click"" for feedback if you press down on the location of the home key. You also can lightly touch the home key and it will respond, like the back and menu keys...The size is nice. The screen is narrow enough that I can reach across the entire screen with my smaller hands, and it is tall/long enough to allow more of a webpage to be read on the screen at one time...Bixby seems like another S voice knockoff that doesn't quite do things as well as Google Voice. There are some youtube videos showing cool tricks you can do with Bixby that can't be done with the other voice apps, but they seem like tricks rather than useful tools. I ended up disabling Bixby, and there are some low-cost apps available to help you do that. The placement of the Bixby button so close to the volume buttons actually ends up with a lot of accidental Bixby pop-ups when you are trying to adjust the volume...The camera is awesome. It starts up quickly and the autofocus is fast. There is plenty of on-board memory for photos and video. One somewhat hidden feature in the Edge is the Animation portion of the Smart Select. You can select an area of the screen while a video is playing and create a GIF. Perfect for making a reaction GIF..",0
3.0,"Mix of good and bad.  You will need to buy an accidental damage warranty, because this phone is super fragile.","September 6, 2017",0,"For context, in the past three years, I have used a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an LG G5 for my personal line, and an iphone 5s for my work line.  I have been using the S8 for a little while now and it's a mix of upgrades and downgrades from my previous phones.  Before I go into my review, I would like to point out that this review is for the second S8 phone that I got.  The first one (which I ordered from samsung.com) arrived defective, where a dime-sized portion of the touch screen was completely unresponsive out of the box.  While I'm sure every phone manufacturer will ship some defective devices, this has definitely lowered my confidence in Samsung's quality control.  Also, the Samsung customer support is the worst I've ever dealt with, and I spent 9 phone calls and over 13 hours trying to get the issue resolved.  If you do buy the device, buy from a third party (amazon, best buy, verizon, - just not samsung's online store) Here is my review of my second (non-defective) s8 device:..1. The screen - First the good: It gets relatively bright outdoors, and is a high quality screen.  Now the bad:  The curve of the screen is the worst feature of the phone.  Sure, it makes the phone look fancy, but it actually makes the phone functionally worse.  When watching full screen videos, you will always have a  distracting glare on the curved edges of the screen.  This effectively means that every movie you watch in landscape mode will have the top and bottom of the movie distorted and annoying to watch.  Second, I have occasionally accidentally activated the back button with my hand when reaching over to the far edge of the screen, and this is definitely because the curve of the screen allows this.  The curve also makes it more difficult to get a glass screen protector that will make full contact with the screen.  And when you do find one, you'll still end up with a non-contact spot if you dont install it precisely in the right spot.  (I wasted a screen protector trying to find the right position.)..2 - Performance - The performance of the phone is pretty great.  I haven't had any hiccups and everything seems to be running smoothly...3 - Battery Life - So far the battery is better than any of the phones I have previously had.  It gets me through the day with roughly 45% left at the end of the day.  That's from 7:30am to around 11pm.  I'd estimate I probably use around 4 to 5 hours of screen-on time during a full day.  I really dont like that the battery is not user-replaceable, but that's the world we live in now.  Based on how batteries degrade over time,  I suspect that a year from now, the battery life will not be as good as it is now, and I will have no way to replace it on my own...4 - Cameras - The front and back cameras work well.  I do miss the dual back camera that my LG G5 had, because once in a while a wide angle shot would have been useful.  If you have never used a dual back camera before, you obviously wont miss it.  But if you have, you might be in the same boat wishing that samsung had included it...5 - Fingerprint scanner - The offset location of the fingerprint scanner is odd.  If you use the phone without a case on it, this will probably annoy you as locating it by feel is not super easy.  I always have a case on it though, and this solves the problem.  With the case on it, my finger is immediately  able to find the edge of the cutout in the case, landing it directly on the scanner.  As long as your finger lands on it, the fingerprint scanner is actually quite responsive...6. Bixby - I have only used the voice assistant bixby a few times, so these are only my initial impressions.  I have used Bixby pretty successfully using voice commands to have it read and send text messages without me having to look at or touch the phone.  This is better than my experience with google now.  The bixby button is annoyingly easy to accidentally press though.  It hasn't been a consistent issue for me yet, but if my fingers dont learn to avoid it, I may start looking to see if there are any workarounds to remap or disable the button...7 - Build and design quality - This is where all of the professional review sites have gotten it wrong.  Most of the review sites praise this phone for ""feeling premium"" and having a great design. I'm sorry to say but they clearly have no understanding of what premium build quality is.  If they mean it feels like solid glass, yeah it does, because it is.  Both the front and back are glass.  Sure my fingers feel the glass too, but solid and smooth doesn't mean premium.  What my brain knows when it's holding glass is that it's holding something fragile.  I'm an engineer, and this is how I would design a phone if I wanted it to shatter in a drop.  The curved screen makes it worse, as it's significantly more likely that an impact will occur against the glass.  Also, because of the curve, there are no phone cases that will wrap around the sides of the phone.  This means even with a case there is a good chance you will damage your phone if you drop it.  If you buy this phone, you should probably also get a accidental damage warranty, and expect to pay something like a $100 deductible on top of that if/when you drop the phone.  I hope this design fad goes away, because I would much prefer a phone with a flat screen and an aluminum or plastic back...8 - Water Resistance - The phone is supposed to be water resistant, but honestly I didn't have the guts to check, so I'll have to take their word for it...Overall - This is a mix of good and bad features.  The problem is, there aren't that many device options for a Verizon user who prefers android.  I would have gone with the LG G6, but after the build quality and GPS issues that I (and many other people, apparently) experienced with the G5, I dont really want to buy another LG phone.  The Moto Z2 series looks good, and I'd love to have a phone I don't have to be concerned about dropping, but the phone is bigger than I'd like.  The S8 is a nice size.  Given the other options out there, I don't regret my s8 purchase, but I don't love the phone, and I'm not confident that I wouldn't have been happier with the Moto Z2 or G6..",2

5.0,Huge display and fun times,"November 2, 2017",0,"The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is one of the largest phones in the market yet it is hard to believe how slim it is. The Infinity Display makes for a huge beautiful screen, which is great for multi-tasking, watching videos and editing pictures, without the distraction of buttons. The size can be a drawback as it is hard to use only one hand unless you activate the one-handed mode. The increased battery size gets me through the day, better than previous models. Having used the fingerprint authentication on my phone for several years, I was a bit disappointed in the placement of the S8’s scanner. It is hard to reach, requires me to pick up my phone and I keep smudging my camera. However, I switched over to the iris scanner and it is amazingly fast. I wear glasses and it has worked with them in various lighting conditions with only an occasional adjustment. Some additional features are included with the camera, such as masks and stickers, similar to other social photo apps, and one unique feature is using Bixby search. Though it is not 100% accurate, it does a decent job of finding similar objects just by the picture. It is actually kind of humorous to see what other things it comes up with, like my buddies dog was identified as a Labrador retriever, horse and cattle. He does seem as big as a horse or cow though. Bixby is an interesting feature that is Samsung’s attempt at competing with Apple’s Siri and improving on their own S-Voice. With the dedicated button you can avoid the usual opening commands of “Hey …” or “OK …” and go straight into what you need. You can still use the voice command of “Hi Bixby” to get things done if you choose to, but I prefer to just hold the button and start dictating. Bixby does all of the usual commands to help you easily send messages, place calls, set timers and reminders. You can also get Samsung Reward points by using Bixby and gaining experience points. This includes just playing around with Bixby and asking some ridiculous questions like “rap for me.” In return your earned points can get you gift cards or chances to win prizes. Bixby will also read off the time, weather and news highlights aloud for your alarms, a nice touch when waking up in the morning.",0
5.0,Best phone out there compared to others.,"September 5, 2017",0,"I had iphone 6+ and changed to the S8. I did not like the over size and weight iphone 6+ and I did not like the small screen size of the iphone 6. The S8 is much smaller and lighter and has a bigger screen which is amazing. The display is way better than iphone 6+ and also is OLED which iphone doesn’t have and maybe the next gen iphone will have on its most expensive model. Pictures and movies look far superior than on the iphone. I needed and unlocked phone so when I travel to other countries I just drop in a sim card from that country and not have to pay roaming charges etc..The S8 supports wireless charging in which I bought an after market wireless charger stand for $16 and works excellent and also can charge while on its side which is nice when watching movies. The screen looks like miniature movie theatre when watching full length movies and most movies fill the entire screen..The memory can expand to 2 TB when available but I just stuck in 128 gig sd card for now. I have lots of FLAC lossless music and it takes up lots of space and also have lots of HD movies. By the way Apple does not support FLAC lossless music which is the most prolific lossless music format available. And also the S8 video is 4k so that takes a lot of memory. You need to up the resolution in settings as the default is not the highest..The benchmarks show that the S8 is twice as fast as the iphone 6+. The battery life seems good but did not have it long enough. Some people say that the battery life is average but with the much higher speed and higher resolution graphics, the tradeoff of slightly less battery life is fine with me. Also the weight factor and size is important to me..It has a built in pulse sensor and O2 sensor which works good and can calculate stress level also..When plugged into my Dell I7 notebook it sees the internal memory and the SD card so easy to load files from the computer. However when plugged into my Acer Aspire I5 desk computer it sees the S8 but not the internal or external memory. Also when using my wifi file transfer app it only can access the internal memory and does not see the external memory..The fingerprint sensor works excellent and after a few times I had no problem putting my finger on the sensor and not accidently on the camera lens. I don’t know why people complain as it is a no brainer after a few times only. I find the fingerprint sensor to be very fast and 100% accurate. However I use the retina sensor to unlock the phone and works excellent also and very fast and 100% accurate so I don’t use the fingerprint sensor unless I have to..I do not know how the new iphone 8 will compare of course but with the new iphone OS 11 you won’t be able to run any 32 bit programs so many programs will not work after the upgrade. The S8 also retains the headphone jack which is important to me and apple got rid of it of course forcing you to use and adapter. The S8 uses the  C type usb connector which is much better and more robust than the micro usb that most phones come with and now appears to be the industry standard for portable devices..The phone is also waterproof to a certain extent but I did not test it and not sure how water will not get into the headphone jack. The earphones that come with the phone are throw away type but maybe ok for phone call and with good earphone and or headphone the sound is excellent with FLAC lossless music..I like the fact that I can open multiple windows and switch back and forth quickly which Apple OS can’t do and also there is always a back button which somehow Apple feels is not necessary so going back to a previous page etc. is impossible unless the app itself contains a back button. It is also easier to add items in groups than the Apple OS. Lots of other features makes this phone easier to use and manage than the Apple OS..As soon as you get this phone you need to buy a case and a good screen protector obviously due to the front and back being glass. The case would make the size a little bigger but not as big and cumbersome as the 6+..I have not used the Bixby and the left Bixby button should be user programmable so the user has control as to what you want it to do. There are other options to use other than Bixby of course..To conclude, there is no perfect phone but this has the fewest problems of the phones I’ve encountered up until now and I bought this on sale making the price much cheaper than the comparable iphone also....",0
5.0,I can confidently say this phone is pretty damn good,"November 4, 2017",0,"I found the opportunity to test the Galaxy S8+ fully expecting to have mediocre reactions to it. After a few weeks, I can confidently say this phone is pretty damn good...The biggest issue I had with samsung phones is the cumbersome overlay and bloatware that seemed to bring the phone to a grinding halt. My previous experience with the Note 4 wasn't lost on me. It worked well at first but lag made it a chore to use. It's only been a few weeks but I've noticed no lag. Apps open zippily; the camera is quick to use. No longer does it seem like there are a million useless apps to clog things up. The new Touchwiz interface seems much more sleek and the Samsung software actually useful. Whichever apps you don't like, you can simply disable. In fact, I find notifications that the phone has disabled unused apps running in the background very reassuring...The display is beautiful. Stunning image quality. I love watching videos on it. Yes, samsung tends to oversaturate images but you can choose to turn this down. Blue light display helps at night to reduce strain on my eyes. Edge-to-edge infinity screen with minimal bezels makes this a beauty to look at, and I receive many compliments on it...Picture quality is great on the camera. Low-light is OK, but day-and-night over my previous iPhone 6. I miss the dual-lens available on the Note 8, but for a single lens, this is great...Battery life is excellent. I use it pretty heavily for music, chat and web browsing through the day and I never run low. If I need a charge, fast-charge gives me a lot of juice with just 10-15 minutes plugged in...Cons:.Bixby isn't great. It doesn't seem to wake up half the time with voice commands. While it's not necessarily bad, it offers no real advantages in my daily use to Google Assistant, which conveniently is also available on this device...Fingerprint scanner. Takes getting used to but with a case, is much more easy to find. Not a deal-breaker by any means...Speaker is terrible. There's a single speaker at the bottom of the phone which is easy to accidentally cover up. I use headphones most of the time, however, and as this is now one of the few phones that still has a headphone jack, is no problem...This is by far the best phone I've had, and I'm glad I went with this over the iPhone X which is going for nearly double the price.",0

I read many reviews before buying it and was all prepared to go through the drama everyone said with activating.  First I connected to my WiFi and transferred everything. Which was simple. The phone walked me through connecting the sub and my old droid. The transfer took 1hr 17m. Then I removed my sim card insert it. The phone detected it was a Verizon SIM and completed update. I was able to make a call immediately. The phone walks you through every feature and it is so simple. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This phone is worth it.,2
3.0,Great phone but you'd better get a case for it!,"July 25, 2017",0,"Great phone for the most part. Broke the glass on the back the first day by inadvertently leaning on it while it was in my pocket. Also chipped the back when it dropped 2 feet onto concrete. GET A CASE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! Also, I wish the fingerprint scanner was on the front instead of the back of the phone so you could unlock it without picking it up.",5
1.0,No sale.So much data mining that it effects battery life.,"October 16, 2017",0,"I was skeptical at first when switching from Apple IPhone 7 to the Galaxy 8 after using Apple products for a long time.  Well after using it for a few weeks its going back for an IPhone 8.  Most of the basic features were ok and worked fairly well but had tons of app crashing than with Apple.  The main thing I hated here was you could never fully disable Google data raping.  My phones battery was literally draining due to all the back ground app data sharing with google and if you disable it it's still turned on it 50 other places it 50 different ways.  The display, ease of use, quality and value for money pales next to the IPhone.  if Android was not made by Google it might be a better mobile OS.  The software spends so much time data mining it lags the rest of the experience.  The phone is also cheaply built for such a priming price not to mention its lacklustre battery life even with battery saver compared to iPhone 8 or X.",7
5.0,"Uses a nano sim, not a micro sim","August 29, 2017",1,"Works great. Only problem I ran into was not knowing that this phone uses a nano sim instead of a micro sim, so I had to convert my sim card to the smaller size. I cut it down with scissors and it did the job. If you don't feel confident in your cutting abilities, you can go to a cell phone shop and ask them to cut it down for you. Phone is fast and was easy to set up. Works well with T-mobile.",3
3.0,"Good quality and camera, but laggy software and bad fingerprint placement","September 12, 2017",1,"I had this phone for about 2 weeks, but I ended up returning it. The camera was really great and took quality photos. I also like the overall design and feel the phone felt very premium. But ultimately I didn't enjoy the Samsung skin over Android, and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the OnePlus 3. Additionally the placement of the fingerprint sensor was very annoying to me as a left handed person who holds their phone and their left hand of majority of the time. It was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use.",3
4.0,"Cool Phone, OK battery","August 14, 2017",1,"Phone is cool, can definitly do a lot with it. For once I actually found some of the pre-installed apps to be usefull. Disapointed in the battery life, not nearly as good as all the hype.",5
5.0,Definitely get this phone,"December 4, 2017",0,"I purchased my Galaxy S8 from the Samsung site only because they gave me $200 for my old phone (Galaxy S5). I was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. I have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions...1. Red screen: This was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. The phone does have a setting that is called ""blue light filter"", which I find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. With this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. Otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. So I had absolutely no issues here. The screen resolution and size are exceptional...2. Fingerprint scanner: It's on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. At first, I'll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since I had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. However, the minute I got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. At this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers I have registered and is many times better and faster than the one I had in my prior phone. I am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever I hold a different phone. So again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. I actually like the location of the scanner now...3. Size: I had a Galaxy S5, which had a 5.1"" screen. This one has a 5.8"" screen and feels much better. The S8 feels long at first but the dimensions ""make sense"" and you quickly get used to it. There's even an advantage here: I normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the S8 a bit longer I can grab it more easily than I did the S5. I have found the S8 much more comfortable than the S8+ both to carry and to hold, and I haven't missed the extra half inch that the S8+ has...4. Hardware and performance: This is a top-of-the-line phone and I have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything I can think of. Videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than I am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. The phone also comes standard with AKG headphones and they are by far the best I've had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, I feel like they will last for a long time. I also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever I was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn't get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. I bought the phone in Coral Blue and the phone color is very attractive...5. Some things I do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that's why I gave the phone 5 stars):.5A) Sometimes I don't get notification sounds if, for example, I receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). I just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. I have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. I'm sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now I cannot trust notification sounds 100%. Note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time..5B) Like I said before, the headphones are absolutely great. However, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. This is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue..5C) Bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with Google Assistant, which I have found even better than Siri at times. I would just prefer that the physical Bixby button could be configured to use with Google Assistant. It's also a minor issue, since I can always press and hold the home button and get Google Assistant just as easily..5D) There are some web pages where, if you're watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. This can be solved by hitting the back button but it's inconvenient. Note: I found that this is true also for the iPhone 8 that my buddy has. Also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine..5E) I was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the Samsung store for this phone. Then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. I have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don't quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. I would recommend that you save your money and don't buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won't work. I would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but I can't have one, unless it's the plastic one Samsung sells...6. In summary: The phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it's great. It's also an impressive piece of hardware, so when I'm alone I also enjoy it quite a bit. I have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when I'm in a call since I have had this phone; I can also say that I can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. The camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. Also, I came from a Galaxy S5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the S8 was very quick and easy, and I was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now.........",0
5.0,It's really mine!,"October 28, 2017",1,"Oh yeah! Few things I have emotional response to when pleased, but this phone, I love him! The wrap around edge beautiful. Hi def screen. Options in depth..I'm getting to like Bixby too. It's helping open controller I can't find, look up things on the web, dial, message, calculate, set timer, define. Still exploring that feature..Fingerprint unlocks quickly. The complaints about location next to camera, I guess I got used to it faster than the average monkey! Since I use the phone in a holder in the car, I added a 3rd print, for when I reach over the phone in the holder, right index finger upside down..Iris recognition, cumbersome.  But when fingers are wet or in gloves, print reader fails. So iris scanner helps..Using for music and internet radio at the gym with belt holder and Bluetooth earphones. Nice custom sound setting for the headset, rich!.Way way better than my S5..Like the feature that if stolen and they reset the phone, it will not work without my unlock info! So don't even Try to steal it!.",0
4.0,Not Perfect!  but... A Solid Buy!,"December 20, 2017",0,"I have had this phone for about 5 months now. Now I have owned the S4, Note 4 and now the S8. Samsung is notorious for lag after some months of use. As a previous Samsung phone owner I took some steps to try and mitigate any lag as best I could. I install AVG Cleaner and consistently let it run to clean my device of any unnecessary junk. I reboot it at least once a week! I clear it's ram and delete any background memory hogs that might slow it down. Despite this it has managed to lock up on me at least twice in the 5 months that I can remember and self reboot. There is still some latency but overall it has been pretty responsive. Given the option to purchase it again now that I have had it for 5 months I can't say I would have made another choice. After 5 months it's still a solid phone and in my opinion one of the best phones available as of writing this review.  When I was looking for a new phone to buy 5 months ago I was seriously considering leaving the Samsung line, I was fed up with their notorious lag and wanted something more stable. On the day I decided to buy the phone Samsung had the best deal out. I am glad I waited a while and didn't buy it as soon as it hit the shelves. The price dropped and it came with two free gifts!..Verdict... Great phone! Not perfect!  but... Just Great!",1
5.0,This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek,"December 6, 2017",0,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!..Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home’ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible...This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ‘Home’ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!..The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR...When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I’ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it’s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ‘Camera’). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ‘Foodies’, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!..Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ‘Talk and Surf’ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it’s a toss up!..As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and haven’t gone back!   .",0
2.0,Front glass designed horribly!,"December 7, 2017",0,Phone works great but extremely disappointed in the design.  In this case front glass replacement.  Doesn't matter if you have insurance or not it's gonna cost you 150 to 300 dollars.  I consider this a design flaw but Samsung is pleading otherwise...I dropped my phone only six to eight inches off the ground and cracked the front screen.  I've had other phones like the note 3 and 5 and were dropped from higher places and screen fine.  I'm just fortunate enough to have my touch screen still working for now...I'd rate this phone better if it was designed to easily replace the screen..,2

4.0,Samsung beats Apple on design?,"August 19, 2017",0,"Long time iPhone user that was moved to try the Galaxy S8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. Unfortunately, I had to return the S8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 T-Mobile LTE connection. T-Mobile blamed Samsung, Samsung blamed T-Mobile, so I just returned the thing. I went back to my iPhone 7+ ready to put the whole S8+ experience down as a failed experiment. I originally ordered the S8+ from Samsung's website. The user experience of the purchase and return, compared to Apple, was crude and confusing. I had to call Samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with Samsung was awful. Everything I was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do...But here's the thing, as I went back to using my iPhone 7+, iOS just felt so... boring. And the iPhone 7+ design, which I had previously liked, looked so... dated...Now let's face it, Android is a mess. Duplicated functionality, inconsistent UX, and the Android upgrade and update situation is pathetic. But Android felt exciting! And boy do I miss that S8 screen and overall phone design...Then there is this year's Apple contenders. Sure, Apple hasn’t announced anything yet, but with all the leaks we pretty much know that two of the iPhones will continue the tired 3-year old iPhone 6 design, and the new AMOLED iPhone with that ugly notch?..Have you seen the leaks of the Galaxy Note 8? What a stunner!..I'll wait for Apple to officially announce, but if the leaks and rumors end up being true - call me a glutton for punishment - I’m all over that Galaxy Note 8!..Update: 9/19/17 - now that the iPhone X has been announced and the Note 8 is available, I bought another S8+, and this one is functioning just fine. I don't like the iPhone X's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features aren’t things I would ever use. I didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the Note 8 over the S8+.  With the Galaxy S8+, I think I have the best looking phone on the market today at a reasonable price (got it on sale), even if I have to put up with Android's goofiness...",1

2.0,Software bloat kills great hardware.,"January 22, 2018",0,"This is a mostly good phone with lots of positives.  It has a great screen, good speakers for calls and playing music, and the touch interface is very responsive.  I even like the curved, edge-to-edge display. However, Samsung seems to be emerging as the king of bloat and has loaded the phone with Samsung's redundant software that adds zero value other than to make Suman feel they are Apple.  Bixby is just terrible.  In fact, it was still in beta when the phone was released.  It offers nothing over Google Assistant or Cortana and yet Samsung added a dedicated button for it and one keeps getting promoted to set it up which I will not do again.  Samsung Pay is completely unnecessary.  The list goes on but Samsung had a great phone going until the software team got involved and junked it up.",2

Before this S8 I had an S5 and it was a very nice transition...This phone works and works well. I love that it's water proof and when it gets dirty I  just hold it on under running water and scrub if with hand soap. The naked phone is a bit slippery so I highly recommend the otter box defender case...I bought this phone on sale during Prime Day which gave a nice $200 discount plus they threw in a few free toys. The package included the wireless charging pad which I use everyday but would never pay extra for. It's really not necessary. And it came with the VR goggles which I still haven't taken out of the box. I know the goggles need the naked phone and I keep my phone in the otter box case so I'll never use the goggles.

3.0,Didn't like it.,"December 30, 2017",1,"So I've owned a Pixil for a couple of years and then put it the washing machine.  Oops. I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with ""Hi, Bixby"". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is ""Ok, Google"". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil.",0

Don't buy this stuff in AT&amp;T; store either. It'll cost 5x!  Strange charging cord, all my old ones are obsolete.

I've had it for 2 1/2 months and so far so good. But Samsung is notorious for their phones doing good for the first 6 months and then crapping out because of their software updates. We'll see. I did go for the Sprint 12 month Forever Galaxy Plan so I don't have to wait every two years to upgrade...The interface is much more intuitive than the iPhone 6. Gorgeous 5.8"" edge to edge Infinity screen. I like how you can crop the screen on YouTube videos. They do need to patch the software to allow users to keep that feature on at all times. Annoying not having that option. Great speakerphone. Loud and clear!..Overall, probably the best smartphone on the market right now. As of this post, Apple just announced their new iPhone X. I remember when Samsung was playing catch-up with Apple, now it's the opposite. The iPhone X seems like a copy of the GS8. Front and back glass. 5.8"" curved screen. Probably the same 18.5 by 9.0 ratio screen as well. I don't think most people care for those fat and wide phones, I know I don't. The GS8 is narrow and comfortable in your hand, still sporting a huge screen size for a smartphone...I was watching Fox News when the iPhone X was announced and these people, who by the way all seem to be on the Apple bandwagon, were cheerfully saying and bragging about the X's face recognition, like this was some new technology. The GS8 already has that going back to the Note 7, as well as having iris scanning which the X doesn't have...Did anyone see that jerk CEO Tim Cook brag about the X's feature of their interactive emoticons, using a pile of crap with a funny face?

It really is too big for your pockets.  Cut a piece of foam board the size of the device and carry it around with you for a few days...Other than the missing features, this phone seems to work fine.

It sounds like I'm playing whatever I'm listening to (mostly music and podcasts) from the inside of a box. I thought the muffled noise issue might have something to do with water exposure after being near the shower (I know, I know, water resistant does not mean waterproof), so I took some precautionary measures as soon as I noticed the distortion, turned it off, and tossed it in a bag with silica gel overnight. For a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output...Additionally, the phone is a lot less durable than one would expect.

The phone works incredibly well and performs my level of work I need it to do with no problems. :)",1
5.0,S8+ is a Plus,"November 6, 2017",0,"Samsung has created a wonderful upgrade to the S7. First of all, the 8+ has an increased screen size with superior clarity. The resolution is by far the best that I've seen on a smartphone. Also, the camera is very easy to maneuver with great quality pictures. There are many options to use to get creative. Next, the internal storage is quite adequate and double the S7's. My favorite feature is the battery life. Prior phones seemed to need charging constantly. The 8+ holds a charge very well and requires minimal charging. Since I am often ""on the go"", this feature is invaluable! Finally, the processor is far superior. I immediately noticed a difference when using the S8+. However, I would be remiss not to mention a couple of points that have been difficult to become accustomed to with this phone. The S8+ does not have a physical Home button - which I miss because I am a creature of habit. Also, I am constantly hitting the Bixby button when I am attempting to reach the volume buttons. The positioning of the buttons has been a bit challenging. With all of the positive upgrades, I would definitely recommend this smartphone.",0
4.0,I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+,"September 12, 2017",0,"Operating System:  If you’re a Samsung user, or even if you’ve never owned a Samsung in the past, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+.  This phone is by far the fastest operating phone that Samsung has ever made. This is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up.  This phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it...User Interface:  This phone also has very friendly user interface.  You can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with...Battery Life:  The battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other Samsung’s in the past.  Even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life.  There are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better.  One thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the “always on display”, this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life...Water Resistant:  This is a great feature to have on a phone.  You never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places.  You will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone...Fast Charging:  You will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible.  Everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use.  With this charger your phone will be charged in no time...Bixby:  The Bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and it’s supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone.  This is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free.  The one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off....",1
3.0,Awful for mobile photographers,"September 30, 2017",0,"Awful for photographers. Notice I said photographers and not photography because I'm not referring to the phone camera itself, I'm referring to the phone display. I shoot pictures on both digital and film to share on social media. The camera on the phone is great, not on par with some other flagship offerings, but the ability to shoot raw dng and edit in phone is much appreciated. However, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, I must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. And I knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as MKBHD warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. Here's where the issue lies for me. I shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. When I upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. I checked the images on an a few iPhones and LG phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. This poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on Galaxy phones think I suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. When taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why I picked this phone, the colors I see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! So my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering I wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? I will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue. I just wish the display wasn't so pumped up like it is. Also I adjusted the display colors to cool it down as much as possible and the skin tones are still awful...The phone itself is top of the line, blazing fast, durable, water proof, detailed display. Nothing more you can ask for in a phone besides more muted reds in the display..",2
3.0,Merely Ok,"December 7, 2017",0,"Pros:.* Battery life is great.  I got a full day off of one charge with regular use..* Screen is bright and vibrant.* Camera is great..Cons:.* Curved edges to the phone make it slippery and slightly distort the image.  They make the phone pretty to look at it when it's off but that's no that point..* Fingerprint sensor on the back is hard to reach. Plus, it's right next to the camera lens so you smudge up the lens trying to read your finger..* Comes bundled with Samung's Bixby AI assistant that you can't uninstall.  It's triggered off of a button on the side that is only used for Bixby...Moved to this from a Note 4 and I miss my old Note.  It was easier to hold and non-rounded edges gave it more usable screen space..",0
5.0,I see some reviews complain on here about features that can be easily disabled.,"October 12, 2017",0,"I have 2 of these, one for me and one for my girlfriend.  They both are flawless in performance and features.  I see some reviews complain on here about features that can be easily disabled.... which makes no sense... one if you dont like a feature it can be disabled ( bixby, always on display)  but why pay $500+ for a phone to not get the most out of it...Pros:.1. Battery life is amazing, i can have this game playing a game for hours with brightness and graphics all the way up and then look at my battery life, and it still be 50%.2. charge time is better, with the provided charger, and pugin  it takes less than 2 hours to charge 0-75%..3. Bixby... although many dislike her, this is the best attempted AI ever provided.  It learns what apps i use and what times i sleep. always watching but a Great mobile AI... want to say the first I believe. (yeah siri isn't AI, it doesn't learn based on past inputs as bixby does.).",1
2.0,Mostly Crap...,"February 26, 2018",0,Wanted to love this as I am sick to death of Crapple and their need for two years to copy Samsungs upgrades.  The phone itself is powerful and teh tech specs are tops.  I hate the typing as its no where near Apple.  Koreans never bother to learn English anyway so its not hard to understand.  Its beneath them to do such.  The phone calls coming in on top of the current call take away as the beep just continues over and over.  The music player is lacking as well.  Text are also a pain as app compete with other apps for default status.  Such a pain.  I will probably try LG next.  Samsung products are high tech but mostly crap from what I have seen in my years.,0
5.0,Amazing phone.,"September 20, 2017",0,"I'm rating 5 stars to counteract the carrier shills who tell you not to buy this phone. They are wrong. Anybody who tells you not to buy this because of ""updates"" is a fool. The Unlocked phone is literally the best version, because it works everywhere, and you will never be stuck on a carrier with it. You pick this phone, and you can use whichever carrier has the best service in your area. You won't be under contract, you won't have any obligations, and you get the best price. Buy once, cry once, as they say...Not only that, but you get the phone as Samsung intended, with all features (Samsung Cloud, Caller ID, Device Maintenance) intact and zero carrier meddling...",0
1.0,Defective phone and defective customer service.,"September 27, 2017",0,This phone sucks.  It keeps freezing and having errors and is unusable. I have not had a phone for months as Scamsung keeps refreshing the software and sending  it back to me. No one at Scamsung will honor the warranty. Last Scamsung product i will ever buy.,6
